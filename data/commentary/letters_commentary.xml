	  <p><mentioned>For the onely . . . one legge.</mentioned>: A crucial passage on the difficulty of adapting classical prosody
	    to English verse. Greek and Latin prosody is a system that organizes syllable quantity, ‘length’, 
	    into patterns, the prosodic length of a word’s syllables—<hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">the measure of the Number</q></hi> being
	    determined by a set of rules based on the spelling, derivation, — grammatical inflection, and ancient pronunciation of 
	    the word as well as its position in a sequence of words. Whereas speech-stress and syllable length are only loosely related 
	    from the standpoint of classical prosody, several early English quantitative poets, Spenser included, seemed to regard stressed 
	    syllables in English as the likely candidates for treatment as metrically long.
	    (This confusion of stress and quantity is still with us, leading us to speak of stressed syllables as ‘long’.)   </p>
    <p>According to the rules of Latin prosody, a syllable preceding the juncture of ‘n’ and ‘t’
      should be long, but Spenser’s ear tells him that the second syllable of <hi rend="italic">Carpenter</hi> is unstressed,
      hence his reference to the unstressed syllable as <hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">used shorte in speache</q></hi>. (Unfortunately,
      Spenser, Harvey, and many of their contemporaries use the same terms, <hi rend="italic">short</hi> and <hi rend="italic">long</hi>,
      to describe differences of both quantity <hi rend="italic">and</hi> stress, hence the description of an unstressed
      syllable as ‘shorte in speache.’) This clash—that a syllable ‘short in speach’ should be ‘long in Verse’—is 
      roughly what Spenser refers to when he speaks of the <hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">Accente</q></hi> as <hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">comming shorte of that it should</q></hi>.  
      </p>
    <p>Spenser adduces <hi rend="italic">Heauen</hi> as a problem similar to <hi rend="italic">Carpenter</hi>. The entire word is
      <hi rend="italic">used</hi>—i.e., usually pronounced—<hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">shorte as one sillable</q></hi> (hence its frequent
      spelling as ‘heav’n’ or ‘heau’n’). But Spenser apparently regards the spelling as dictating, in
      verse, a peculiarly lengthened monosyllabic scansion. (‘<hi rend="italic">Diastole</hi>’ can have many meanings in
      classical prosody, but Spenser apparently adduces it here as the term for the irregular use of a short
      syllable as if it were metrically long.) He <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be suggesting that the orthography
      dictates a disyllabic scansion—this is evidently how Harvey understands him (3.517-37)—although
      his own practice at 4.90 suggests that he regards ‘heauenlie’ as disyllabic. (Harvey objects
      at 5.64, insisting that, spelled thus, the word should be regarded as a trisyllable.) 
      Spenser laments that, in the case of both <hi rend="italic">Carpenter</hi> and
        <hi rend="italic">Heaven</hi>, a reader attempting to adapt her pronunciation to the claims of prosodic rule
      must distort a word’s customary pronunciation—an unstressed second syllable in the case
      of <hi rend="italic">Carpenter</hi>; a single, short syllable in the case of <hi rend="italic">Heaven</hi>—by means of an
      unnatural stress or lengthening. Spenser registers the fact that the unnatural adjustment in
      each case is slightly different by adopting different similes to describe them—<hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">‘like a lame Gosling</q></hi>
      and <hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">like a lame Dogge’</q></hi>.</p>

    <p><mentioned>But it . . . Use.</mentioned>: 
      It seemed to Harvey, as it has to many
      subsequent interpreters of this letter, that Spenser was here arguing that the adjustment of
      <hi rend="italic">accente</hi> to <hi rend="italic">number</hi> was to be achieved by cultivating the habit (‘custome’)
      of pronouncing <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> English <hi rend="italic">words</hi> in such a way as to <hi rend="italic">subdue</hi> normal
      accent and to bring out prosodic quantity, hence Harvey’s outraged response: <q who="Spenser"><hi rend="italic">you shal never
        have my subscription or consent (though you should charge me wyth the authoritie of five
        hundreth Maister Drants,) to make your</hi> Carpēnter<hi rend="italic">, our</hi> Carpĕnter<hi rend="italic">, an inche
          longer, or bigger, than God and his Englishe people have made him</hi> </q>(3.448-452). (It is not clear
      whether Harvey supposed Spenser to be proposing that his countrymen and women should pronounce
      English verses in classical metres according to unnatural rules, that they should undertake a
      wholesale reform of English speech, or that they should simply accept a prosodic rule that clashed
      with ‘native’ quantity.) But Harvey may be partly misunderstanding Spenser. In his next
      sentence, Spenser proposes, in tones of national pride that match Harvey’s, that his
      countrymen and women <hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">measure our Accentes, by the sounde, reserving the Quantitie to the
        Verse</q></hi>: that is, Spenser seems to be proposing a custom of reading English verse—measuring
      accents—according to the patterns of standard English pronunciation of prose,
      with the patterning implicit in quantitative English prosody to be regarded as no more than
      implicit, and not to be pronounced. </p>
    <p>This would not be strange: in <hi rend="italic">Ludus Literarius </hi>(1612), the schoolmaster Richard
      Brinsley explains that Latin verse was properly to be recited according to normal prose
      accent, with no effort to ‘<q>bring out</q>’ prosodic quantity. Brinsley also attests to the utility
      of a form of recitation that he refers to as ‘<q>scanning</q>’, in which quantitative values are
      exaggerated, but he regards this chiefly as an aid to memorizing verse and as a means of
      demonstrating alertness to the underlying metrical structure. When Spenser says that
      <hi rend="italic">Carpenter</hi> is <hi rend="italic"><q who="Spenser">read long in Verse</q></hi> or that <hi rend="italic">Heaven</hi> is 
      <q who="Spenser"><hi rend="italic">stretched out with a</hi> Diastole</q> he may especially be referring both to the underlying metrical design and to
      the exceptional practice of scanning aloud, which was meant to render the metre artificially
      prominent.</p>

    <p><mentioned>I would . . . rest.</mentioned>: The sentence suggests that one of Spenser’s
      chief goals in bringing these letters into wider circulation is to standardize English
      quantitative practice. By adducing the authority of Sidney and Drant, he seems to be stacking
      the deck against Harvey’s ‘<q who="Spenser">rules and precepts</q>’, but the sentence implies that Spenser had
      adopted a pragmatic approach to quantitative prosody: instead of pursuing an ideal
      quantitative system, he seems to be seeking consensus on a set of practicable metrical
      conventions among the interested parties.</p>
    <p>While it is impossible to reconstruct the precise principles that Sidney imparted to Spenser,
      Sidney did write out a list of rules for ‘<q>English measurde verses</q>’ that are preserved in a MS
      of the <hi rend="italic">Old Arcadia </hi>at St John’s, Cambridge that was written in 1581; see Ringler 1962: 391.</p>
    <p>Thomas Drant, the imputed source for Sidney’s rules, was a clergyman and poet educated at St.
      John’s College, Cambridge. He had published translations of Greek and Latin poetry in the
      1560s and at the end of that decade had become a chaplain to Bishop Grindal, to whom he would
      dedicate a collection of Latin poems in the late 1570s. This letter offers the only evidence
      that Drant had developed a set of rules for quantitative versifying in English.</p>
    <p>The evocation of a slightly competitive environment in which disagreeing proponents of
      quantitative practice might be ‘<q who="Spenser">overthrown</q>’ by its opponents is intriguing, especially
      since no evidence survives of opposition, formal or informal, to such versifying. Like E.K.’s
      commentary in <hi rend="italic">SC</hi>, such remarks might be understood as meant to stimulate interest by
      conferring on literary practice the glamour of mystery and controversy.</p>

	  Over a decade later, in the epistle preliminary to <hi rend="italic">Complaints</hi> (1591), 
	  the printer attests to his intention to publish <hi rend="italic">‘The dying Pellican’</hi> along with ‘<q>some

      can acquire copies. We do not know precisely when Spenser began revising the poems first

      which eventually appeared, in <hi rend="italic">Complaints</hi>, as the <hi rend="italic">Visions of Bellay</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Visions of Petrarch</hi>.
	  At <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3.326-328, Harvey praises ‘<q who="Spenser">the extraordinarie veine and invention</q>’ of

      (3.337-339): the odd comparison would not seem far-fetched if the ‘Dreames’ concluded, as do Spenser’s translations
      for <hi rend="italic">Theatre</hi>, with a sequence of visions based on the book of Revelation. But the work
      or works here referred to as <hi rend="italic">Dreames </hi>may in fact be something different altogether; it

      less difficult to propose theories for the ‘<q who="Spenser">advisement</q>’ that may have inhibited him from
      publishing the <hi rend="italic">Stemmata</hi>. In the ensuing Latin sentence, Spenser alleges that he is
      following (<hi rend="italic">sequor</hi>) Harvey; Orwen suggested (<hi rend="italic">N&amp;Q</hi>, 1946) that Spenser’s
        <hi rend="italic">Stemmata</hi> imitates the second book of Harvey’s <hi rend="italic">Gratulationes </hi>(1578), a
      collection of poems in praise of Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, several of which urge
      Leicester’s worthiness as a spouse for the queen. It was a gaffe, for unbeknownst to Harvey,
      Leicester had married Lettice Knollys, Countess of Essex; see <hi rend="italic">SC March</hi> 20n. So Spenser’s advisement may be
      traced to his having followed Harvey in promoting a match that was no longer possible,
      especially if the ‘Apostrophes’ were addressed to the queen. And even if Spenser had not
      followed Harvey quite so closely in the <hi rend="italic">Stemmata </hi>as to propose a royal match, the
      publication of a volume of sustained praise for Leicester might have seemed ill-advised, since
      for years the queen remained nettled at Leicester over the clandestine marriage and Spenser
      seems already to have hoped for the queen’s patronage as well as Leicester’s. Finally, Orwen
      reminds us that the Dudleys had not long been numbered among the gentry and the heralds did
      not agree as to the foundations of Leicester’s aristocratic claims: Spenser may have decided
      to hold back the <hi rend="italic">Stemmata</hi> until the genealogical dispute was settled.

      seek ascent to the place from which the rainwater that generates them originally

      with a range of scientific and philosophical traditions, but carrying distinct meanings in

      thus suggesting that male intellection is a kind of grave flatulence.

      supernatural causation here begins to emerge more sharply: this is not the earth of the
      psalter, trembling before the Lord; it is Aristotle’s earth, suffering from natural distemper. 
      Harvey’s argument is pitched against that of the likes of Arthur Golding, whose <hi rend="italic">Discourse Upon the 
        Late Earthquake</hi> urged that ‘<q>this miracle proceeded not of the course of any naturall causes, but of Gods

      the mountaines to melte lyke wax, and the seas to dry vp and to becom as a drie field, when he listeth

      Harvey’s meaning here is obscure: he seems to be speaking of the fallacy of assigning ends or

      that there is no intelligible purpose for earthquakes or that the final cause of earthquakes
      is beyond the limits of our knowledge. If the latter, Harvey’s treatise would take its place

      Still, having begun his Cambridge career in 1552; he became a fellow of Peterhouse in 1558 and

      a bishopric, Harvey had written to ask Leicester’s support in an appeal to Elizabeth for a
      prebend at Litchfield (Stern, 1979, 49-50); the fiction of the poem’s attendance on ‘my Lorde’

    <mentioned>Matchiavell . . . Unico Aretino</mentioned>: Harvey here surveys the Italian authors who had the
      most obvious and, perhaps, unsettling effect on Harvey and Spenser’s generation of young
      intellectuals. Niccolò Machiavelli’s <hi rend="italic">Prince </hi>(c. 1513, first printed in 1532) and
        <hi rend="italic">Discourses on Livy </hi>(c. 1517, first printed in 1531) made him notorious for the bold
      amorality of his political thought. Baldassare’s Castiglione’s <hi rend="italic">Book of the Courtier</hi>
      (1528) spawned a substantial output of books that described the proprieties of modern
      comportment and meditated on the relation of those proprieties to the exercise of social and
      political influence. (Among the most popular conduct-books indebted to Castiglione’s <hi rend="italic">Book
        of the Courtier</hi> were Giovanni della Casa’s <hi rend="italic">Galateo</hi> [1558], and Stefano Guazzo’s
        <hi rend="italic">Civil Conversazione</hi> [1574], a book very different in temper from Castiglione’s.) The
      fourteenth-century poet Francesco Petrarca, or Petrarch—and ‘Petrach’ seems also to have
      been an acceptable English spelling of the name—was
      most famous for the Italian amatory poems in his collection the <hi rend="italic">Rime Sparse</hi>, although
      his Latin epic, the <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>, was fairly well-known and his published correspondence, the
        <hi rend="italic">Familiares</hi>, distantly influenced Spenser’s and Harvey’s <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>. Petrarch’s
      friend Giovanni Boccaccio is now best known for his collection of <hi rend="italic">novelle</hi>, the
        <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi>, and although Boccaccio’s notoriety at Cambridge may well have rested
      primarily on that work, several of Boccaccio’s other writings had considerable influence:
      Chaucer was indebted to both his <hi rend="italic">Filocolo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Filostrato</hi>, and several
      encyclopedic works—a synthetic treatise on Greco-Roman mythology, the <hi rend="italic">Genealogia
        Deorum</hi>; a compendium of tragic narratives, the <hi rend="italic">De Casibus Virorum Illustrium</hi>; and
	  a collection of lives of famous women, <hi rend="italic">De Mulieribus Claris</hi>—were still widely
      consulted. Last in Harvey’s list here is the satirist Pietro Aretino (1492-1556), whom Harvey,
      like E.K., the commentator of the <hi rend="italic">SC</hi>, confused with the Aretine poet Bernardo Accolti
      (1458-1535), known as Unico Aretino to such contemporaries as Castiglione (see <hi rend="italic">SC Jan</hi> gloss
      35). Pietro Aretino wrote in a variety of genres, but his reputation for scurrilousness rested on the
        <hi rend="italic">Ragionamenti,</hi> a collection of whores’ dialogues he wrote in the mid 1530s, and on a
      series of obscene sonnets written to accompany a set of pornographic prints by Marcantonio
      Raimondi, the poems and prints published together in 1524 as <hi rend="italic">I Modi </hi>(‘The

      He is also reflecting on the sudden prestige of continental scholarship and literature, much
      of it written in the vernacular, texts that advance intellectual developments sharply
      distinguishable from the traditions of the Greek and Latin academic curriculum.

      very great influence over her two eldest sons during their reigns as Francis II (1559-60) and
      Charles IX (1560-74). She was more of a partner to her third son, Henry III, assisting and
      advising him in a range of diplomatic maneuvers. When Sir Philip Sidney presumed to write to
      Elizabeth in 1579 to discourage her from entertaining a match with Catherine’s youngest son,
      the Duc d’Alençon, he referred to him as ‘the son of a Jezebel of our Age’ (<hi rend="italic">Works

      here, for the collection and distribution of such information was not yet sufficiently
      developed to be recognizable as such. As is clear from the list that explicates the general
      term, Harvey refers to something vaguer and more encompassing: to information concerning
      affairs of moment; to gossip; to fashions in literature, speech, and apparel; to discoveries
      and imaginings—that is, to anything that might have the power to excite or unsettle.

    <mentioned>newe Elementes . . . Helles to</mentioned>: Harvey here returns to the
      letter’s presiding concern with natural philosophy. The clause seems to refer to disruptions
      of Ptolemaic astronomy, with its limiting sphere of fixed stars, and its composition limited
      to sublunary bodies composed of four elements and celestial bodies composed primarily of a
      fifth, the ether. Harvey’s reference to ‘newe Heavens’, a phrase that echoes Isa 65:17, seems
      to refer to the idea of multiple celestial worlds, first proposed in the fifth century, B.C.E.
      by Leucippus and Democritus, and later taken up by Epicurus, whose ideas were transmitted to
      the Renaissance by means of both Diogenes Laertius’ biography and Lucretius’ <hi rend="italic">De Rerum
        Natura</hi>. (For Lucretius’ chief evocation of multiple heavens and multiple earths, see
        <hi rend="italic">DRN</hi> 2.1094-1105.) The great sixteenth-century exponent of the idea of multiple
      worlds is Giordano Bruno, but Bruno did not arrive in England until 1583 and did not publish
      his treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Infinite Universe and Worlds</hi> (<hi rend="italic">De l'Infinito Universo et
        Mondi</hi>) until 1584. Although, as part of a consideration of the possibility of
      heliocentrism, Nicholas of Cusa had proposed that all stars might be considered like suns,
      Copernicus would not take this step: despite the revolutionary assertion of heliocentrism, he
      retained a single rigid firmament in his cosmological system. But Copernicus’ first important
      English exponent, Thomas Digges, imagined an infinite space, with the stars scattered
      throughout it, thus providing, before Bruno, a conceptual framework in which Cusanus’ idea of
      plural solar-systems could flourish.

      this respect, Harvey here attributes to the young men of Cambridge a gossipy preoccupation
      with an exotic, and perhaps glamorous Ottoman ‘threat’ to Christendom.

    <mentioned>Cappes and Surplesses</mentioned>: One of the central goals of the English
      reformers was the reduction of superfluous Church ceremony and they had especially objected to
      the over-elaboration of ‘massing vestments’. There was general agreement that the so-called
      liturgical vestments, those ecclesiastical garments specifically associated with the Roman
      Catholic service of the mass, were to be rejected, but the question of exactly which
      non-liturgical vestments to proscribe was vigorously argued, with Puritans objecting
      strenuously to the non-liturgical cap and surplice. In 1565, the year before Harvey
      matriculated at Christ’s College, William Fulke had led a protest at St. John’s College against the wearing of the
      surplice and square ‘cater-cap’; during the year following, Archbishop
      Parker’s efforts to enforce vestiarian conformity precipitated a major confrontation with
      non-conforming clergy and may be regarded as a crucial moment in the propagation of Puritan
      separatism. If Harvey here attests to a diminution in the reforming clamor on this subject, at
      least in the environs of Cambridge, it was only a temporary lull.

      support of the Puritan Admonitions to Parliament of 1572, which strongly opposed vestments and
      the episcopal efforts to impose conformity in vestiarian matters. Cartwright spent most of the

      conforming to the terms of the 1559 Act of Uniformity and the Thirty-Nine Articles;
      acquiescent to Elizabethan efforts to maintain episcopal authority; and quite content to wear
      surplice and square cap—but there were many such influential clergymen at Cambridge, and
      quite a few of them were non-resident holders of church benefices. Harvey may be referring to
      Andrew Perne, who also comes under oblique attack a few sentences later in this letter. Five
      times vice-chancellor of Cambridge, Perne held a range of very lucrative livings in addition
      to the deanery of Ely. Perne was a person of such flexible religious allegiances that his name
      became ‘<q>a byword for a religious turncoat</q>’ (Collinson, <hi rend="italic">Elizabethans</hi>, 179). He was later
      much satirized in the Marprelate Tracts and Harvey would frequently speak of him as a fox;
      indeed, in 1592, when Harvey came to explain another obscure satiric moment in this letter
      (2.646), he would designate Perne, ‘<q who="Spenser">the olde Fox</q>’ as the object of attack. Perne is almost

      both canon and civil law, long held the deanships of Canterbury and York, but seems to have
      evaded episcopal appointments, spending much of his time during the reigns of Henry, Edward,
      Mary, and Elizabeth on a range of diplomatic missions. Like Wotton, Gardiner had doctorates in
      canon and civil law, but his career was more vexed. Shortly after graduation he became
      Wolsey’s secretary and, six year’s later, Henry VIII’s; he became Bishop of Winchester in
      1532. He soon came into conflict with Henry over matters of Episcopal authority and,
      thenceforth, he became a powerful conservative force within the English Church, a defender of
      ceremony, advocated clerical celibacy, and dealt harshly, under Edward, with the most eager
      reformers. His conservatism earned him two imprisonments in 1548, and he was deprived of his
      see in 1551, though he was restored to his position in 1553, under Mary, whose religious
      agenda he served with energy until his death.

      Sidney’s Judgement, and Immerito’s Observations—slightly obscures his sense. (Harvey makes
      a related joke in the prior letter (2.545-546) where he asks to be commended to Spenser’s own self and asks Spenser

      recognized a number of rules by which orthography and position determined the quantity of a
      syllable, but these rules were not exhaustive: the length of many syllables could not be
      determined by rule. (For more on ‘length by position’, see the Introduction.)
      Harvey follows Lily (and others) in alleging that, in such cases, the
      practice of early poets determines the quantity on otherwise indeterminate syllables: <hi rend="italic"><q>Quarum verò
        syllabarum quantitas sub praedictas rationes non cadit, à poetarum, exemplo atque autoritate

      to Harvey, the first syllables of <hi rend="italic">τιμὴ</hi>, <hi rend="italic">timē </hi> (‘honor’) and <hi rend="italic">unus</hi> (‘one’)
      were ‘naturally’ short, but Homer and Ennius <hi rend="italic">made</hi> them long by the very act of beginning lines of
      their epics with those words. (Classical epic poems were usually composed in lines of dactylic
      hexameter, the first syllable of which must be long.) </p>
	  <p>The half line from Homer, ‘<hi rend="italic"><q>timē d’ ek dios esti</q></hi>’, may be rendered ‘Honour is from Zeus’ (<hi rend="italic">Il</hi> 2.197); the
      complete line from Ennius’ <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> is <hi rend="italic"><q>unus homo nobis cunctando, restituit rem</q></hi>,
      ‘one man, delaying, restored the state to us’.</p>

<p> Some observations on the scansions may be useful here, especially since Harvey’s
  procedure often seems less than systematic. There are some odd irregularities: he
  usually treats ‘and’ as long, save when followed by ‘h’. His ear for accentual 
  patterning may similarly dictate scanning ‘Not the like’ (9) as a dactyl, despite
  the fact that ‘like’ should be long by position, according to Latin rules of scansion. </p>
	  <p> Harvey elides‘-ie’ followed by a vowel three times (at 9 and 15), treating each
compounded syllable as a short syllable. Inconsistently, having treated the first syllable
of ‘againe’ elided with the last syllable of ‘<hi rend="italic">Trinitie</hi>’ as short in 9, he 
	    treats the first syllable of ‘against’ as long in 12.</p>
	  <p>It is unclear whether ‘Gewe-’ of ‘Gewegawes’ comprises one long syllable or two short
  ones. The scansion of 19 seems especially uncertain.</p>

	  <mentioned>bony</mentioned>: In his own copy, Harvey corrected ‘bonny’ to ‘bony’ 
      at 3.85 in the previous poem. In a similar metrical position, which calls for a short 
      first syllable, the compositorial spelling seems to stipulate a first syllable that is 
      long ‘by position’ (see Introduction); we assume that Harvey would have made the same
      correction as he made in the previous poem, had he noticed the same compositorial lapse.

    <mentioned>bonetto</mentioned>: Harvey here uses an Italian form for ‘bonnet’, a form not
      current in England, although it is difficult to decide whether he chooses it for the slightly
      comic effect or because it fits the metrical scheme.

      former a more prolific poet and the latter a more notorious literary figure, see above 2.588-589. The disapproving
      tone of Harvey’s earlier reference leaves little doubt that Harvey was aware of Pietro
      Aretino’s reputation for literary mischief: his claim that many living poets are ‘<q who="Spenser">as nobly
      minded</q>’ as Aretino must be taken as deftly satiric. Indeed, to describe Aretino as ‘<q who="Spenser">halfe
      Prince to the Princes</q>’ is to suggest the political power of poetic satire.

      Although Harvey and John Lyly had been
      friends, Lyly (among others) apparently brought the poem to the attention of his patron, the
      Earl of Oxford, suggesting that the poem was meant as a personal satire on the Earl, which it
      surely was, although Harvey denied it (<hi rend="italic">Foure Letters</hi>, 1592, C4). For troubles that the
      various provocations of the <hi rend="italic">Letters </hi>brought on Harvey, see the Introduction, p.

    <p>Harvey’s grip on the regularities of dactylic hexameter is especially loose here. 15,
      indeed, seems to require so much latitude—‘ly’ treated as a long syllable, ‘guyses’ treated
      as bisyllabic, with a long second syllable—that one might suspect a transmissional problem.
      The final lines suggest that he continues to treat ‘and’ before ‘h’ as short and, if he means to
      respect this rule throughout, then ‘Tongue, and’ in 18 must be regarded as a dactyl. </p>
    
    <p>The last line deserves special notice, given Harvey’s special attention to the proper scansion
      of ‘Travailer’ at 471-480 below (and the thematic focus on travel in Letter 5). As Harvey makes
    clear in that later discussion, he expects a high degree of coincidence between stress and length and 
    if we take the pattern of quantity as an orchestration of stress, the line has droll force. The constraints
    of the hexameter would promote the second syllable of ‘Travaile’ and thence an awareness of both
    the French origins of the word and of the etymological sense of the laboriousness of travel,
    rendered an oxymoron by the epithets ‘Blessed and happy’. As for ‘Travailer’, which Harvey 
    will later insist should not be scanned with its second syllable as long, despite the Latin rules
    of orthographic quantity, the regularities of the hexameter require that its second syllable be treated
    in the present line as short. Yet, while Harvey’s line effectively rejects any lengthening (by 
    orthography) of the second syllable, the requisite lengthening (by position) of the final syllable effectively gallicizes
    the ‘Travailer’, capitulating to the estrangement of the Englishman that the poem deplores throughout.</p>

	  refer to more than the influence of a book and its concerns. ‘Galateo’ may also personify Italianate
	  mannerism and artificiality: ‘Galateo’ might be taken as a male version of Galatea, the too-attractive

    <mentioned>Largebellyed . . . hose</mentioned>: The continental fashion for the so-called
      peascod doublet, which swells like a peapod at its bottom-most point just at the belly, was
      quite new in England. Harvey is playing with the descriptive epithet, hinting that the peascod
      distention is a debased version of the related form of the codpiece. The ‘half-hose’ are
      breeches, as distinct from whole-hose, an integrated combination of either trunk-hose and
      stockings or trunk-hose, canions (close-fitting ornamental rolls), and stockings. The more traditional silhouette
      of trunk-hose is relatively full at the upper thighs, whereas breeches drop the apparent
      center of gravity farther down the leg. Breeches obviate the need for a codpiece.

    <mentioned>Straite . . . diveling</mentioned>: Harvey turns his satiric attention to the
      rear of the new-fangled doublet. Whereas the Elizabethan undergarment (‘shirt’) was usually
      cut full, the comparison of the rear of the doublet to a shirt suggests some failure of decent
      concealment as the doublet descends to the buttocks, probably from being cut too tight. The
      doublet described here is certainly cut close at the breech, perhaps lacking any panels or
      skirts to mask the attachments of doublet and breeches, and thus suggesting the comic
      self-exposure of a diving duck.

    <p>It is worth noting that because of orthographic rules and the rule of length by position,
      Spenser would probably have regarded ‘like’ and the second syllable of ‘Majestie’ as long
      in these lines. But John Harvey seems to be disregarding such rules here and instead organizes
      his hexameters according to accentual patterns.</p>

      comedies—Bembo had not, but Harvey may have imagined that Bembo’s dialogues, <hi rend="italic">Gli
        Asolani</hi>, were dramatic works—the three authors first named developed a distinctly modern
      satiric vein in comedy. Bernardo Dovizi da Bibbiena’s <hi rend="italic">Calandra</hi> (1507, but substantially
      revised in 1513), is the breakthrough achievement; Bibbiena draws on the plot of Plautus’
        <hi rend="italic">Menaechmi</hi>, although he bases the title character on the simpleton, Calandrino, of
      Boccaccio’s <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi>. Machiavelli contributed two plays to the development of Italian
      comedy, <hi rend="italic">Mandragola</hi> (1518) and <hi rend="italic">Clizia </hi>(1527). Pietro Aretino is a more prolific
      playwright than Bibbiena or Machiavelli, and the most boldly satiric; of the five plays
      collected for publication in 1553 (and placed on the Roman Index of prohibited books five
      years later), the <hi rend="italic">Cortigiana</hi> (1534) is an especially mordant parody of the ethos of
      Castiglione’s <hi rend="italic">Courtier</hi>. (It is possible, if unlikely, that Harvey has again confused

	  <hi rend="italic">Verginia</hi>, first printed in 1513.) For the earlier confusion, see above, 2.588 and 3.131.

      denigrated epic and disapproved, implicitly, of Spenser’s efforts in the form, Harvey reframes
      Spenser’s dual <hi rend="italic">commitment</hi> to comedy and to epic as a <hi rend="italic">competition</hi>—or, rather, as
      a pair of competitions: between the Nine Muses, after whom Spenser had named his comedies, and
      the titular ‘Faerye Queene’ of his epic, and between Apollo, the Muses’ leader and patron, and
      Hobgoblin, whom Harvey suggests is an appropriately trivial daemon of Spenser’s nativist,
      fairy epic. This latter competition between the genre-gods, Apollo, and Hobgoblin, adapts
      legends of artistic competition between the refined Apollo and such rustic challengers as Pan
      and Marsyas (for Apollo’s competition with Pan, see Ovid <hi rend="italic">Met</hi> 11.146-71; for that with
      Marsyas, see <hi rend="italic">Met </hi>6.382-91 and Pseudo-Hyginus <hi rend="italic">Fabulae </hi>165). Harvey’s conception has
      a jocular eccentricity: it specifies Apollo quite untraditionally as the god of comedy, and
      whereas Apollo traditionally punishes his challengers after he triumphs over them, Harvey
      imagines Hobgoblin as fleeing, unpunished, with the stolen garland of victory.

      greetings and healths as she has hairs—half-golden, half-silver, and half-bejeweled—on her
      head. What [more] do you seek? By your Venus, she is another little Rosalind, and your very

      Lady Immerito, my most beautiful Madam Colin Clout, much more than abundant salutations to
      you, and fare well.’</p>
    <p>Harvey is responding to Spenser’s request at 1.76-7 that he write to Spenser’s sweetheart
        (<hi rend="italic">Corculum</hi>). Most commentators suppose the sweetheart to be Spenser’s new wife, on the
      dual evidence of the reference to her as a ‘<q who="Spenser"><hi rend="italic">Domina Immerito</hi></q>’—which may be translated ‘Madam’
      or ‘Lady Immerito’—and the record of Spenser’s marriage to a Maccabaeus Chylde on
      27 October 1579. But the logic of the passage suggests that the ‘<q who="Spenser"><hi rend="italic">Domina Immerito</hi></q>’, the
        ‘<q who="Spenser"><hi rend="italic">bellissima Collina Clouta</hi></q>’ here addressed is not a Mrs. Spenser, but the same
      addressee as that of the preceding three sentences, Spenser himself, albeit affectionately
      feminized. (It may be observed that in classical elegy, the <hi rend="italic">domina</hi> is always a
      commanding mistress and never a wife.) While Harvey’s queer joke may indeed be motivated by
      Spenser’s having married—the joke being that marriage feminizes the besotted groom—Harvey’s
      joke may as easily reflect his sense that there is something perverse in Spenser’s
      having encouraged him to adopt an elaborately affectionate posture towards Spenser’s
      sweetheart—in which case the joke will involve Harvey’s demonstration of a now polymorphous
      and ambidirectional warmth. Difficult as it may be to specify the force of the passage, it
      cannot securely corroborate the theory that Harvey’s correspondent had married Maccabeus
      Chylde.</p>

      have referred to themselves by this name. At 5.50-53 below, Harvey responds to Spenser as if the coterie thus named were
      ‘new-founded’ and, perhaps, comprised only Sidney and Dyer, yet a Latin elegy of Daniel Rogers
      from January of 1579 (reproduced in van Dorsten, <hi rend="italic">Poets, Patrons, and Professors</hi>, 1962:
      175-9) describes a small fellowship of writers that already comprises Sidney, Dyer, and Fulke
      Greville, and Spenser speaks of Sidney and Dyer as ‘<q who="Spenser">having had . . . already great practise</q>’
      of quantitative versifying (4.46-47). Spenser’s turn to quantitative metrics involves taking up an
      activity that Harvey had advocated earlier and that seems to be especially worthwhile now that
      Sidney’s ‘Areopagus’ had interested itself in the enterprise.

    <mentioned>Mystresse <hi rend="italics">Kerkes</hi> . . . Carrier</mentioned>: Spenser relies on Mrs. Kerke, who
      has not been identified, for discreet delivery of his correspondence with Harvey; see below
      (4.258). It has been surmised, on weak evidence, that she was the innkeeper
      at the Bull Inn in Bishopsgate, which was later, and may already have been, one of the London
      termini for carriers transporting goods and letters between London and Cambridge. (The Bell in
      Coleman Street was another such terminus.) It has also been imagined that she is some
      relative to E.K., the glossator of <hi rend="italic">SC</hi>, perhaps his mother.

    <mentioned>shortest . . . <hi rend="italics">Iambickes</hi></mentioned>: Spenser slightly overstates here: the
      trimeter line is not very short. While the iambic foot (‿-) is indeed shorter than the
      dactylic one (-‿‿), Greek and Latin lyric verse is composed in <hi rend="italic">metra</hi>, or metres. Greek
      iambic metres and many Latin ones are composed of pairs of feet (iambic dipodies: x-‿-),
      whereas dactylic metres are composed of single feet and therefore, because a single line of
      iambic trimeter and a single line of dactylic hexameter each contain 6 feet, a line of
      dactylic hexameter will not appear conspicuously longer than a line of iambic trimeter.
      In terms of total allowable duration of the line, the normal Latin dactylic hexameter comprise
      23 to 24 morae (that is, the equivalent of 23-24 short syllables); the normal Latin iambic
      trimeter comprises 18 to 21 morae.

    <mentioned>Maister Preston, Maister Still</mentioned>: Thomas Preston (1537–1598) was a
      reasonably skilled Latin poet, though he is remembered more as the probable author of
        <hi rend="italic">Cambises</hi>. He had been a fellow of King’s College, Cambridge since 1556 and received
      his doctorate in Civil Law c.1576. Preston had received notice from Elizabeth I during her
      visit to Cambridge in 1564, and she interceded on his behalf two decades later, insisting on
      his election as master of Trinity Hall in 1586. As the Cambridge Oratorship came open,
      Preston became one of Harvey’s rivals for the position. For John Still see 2.466n. above.

    <p><mentioned>Iambicum trimetrum</mentioned>: Spenser is adapting the rules of classical iambic trimeter, the most
      widely used meter in spoken passages of classical drama. Greek iambic trimeter consists of
      three dipodies, or pairs of feet, each pair composed of either two iambs or a spondee and an
      iamb (thus, x-‿-); substitutions of paired short syllables for a single long one are allowed
      in all but the final syllable of the line. The Latin adaptation of the iambic trimeter, often
      called the <hi rend="italic">senarius</hi>, was widely used in
      Roman comedy and tragedy (with slightly different rules for each genre). The senarius is organized in feet rather than in <hi rend="italic">metra </hi>and while
      the sixth foot is always an iamb, the preceding five feet often feature even greater freedom
      of substitution than was allowed in Greek trimeter. Spenser has chosen a form that allows
      considerable metrical latitude for his earliest surviving effort in quantitative versifying.</p>
    <p>Although he claims that his practice here is ‘<q who="Spenser">precisely perfecte for the feete</q>’ and in other
      ways strictly regular, it has not seemed so to those readers who have attempted to scan his
      lines. Davison, presumably regarding the second line as defective and the third as
      hypermetrical, transposed ‘Thought’ in his reprinting of the poem in <hi rend="italic">A Poetical
        Rhapsody</hi>; Attridge solved the same problem by treating ‘fluttring’ as a misprint for
      ‘fluttering’ and by scanning the fifth foot of the third line as a dactyl, a substitution
      allowable in the senarius.  (A more elegant solution to the difficulty of the second line might be to emend by interpolating ‘for’ as the second word in the line.)  Harvey is the most explicitly critical: at 5.59-76 below, he notes 
      the inconsistent quantities of l. 2 (though not its defective character) and the hypermetrical
      character of l. 3, and
      chides Spenser for spelling that carelessly obscures what Harvey imagines to be his intended
      scansions, for the overuse of spondees, and for a reliance on initial trochaic substitutions
      that undermines the iambic character of the verse.</p>
    <p>In Davison’s edition of 1602, the poem is arranged into three line strophes, which gives
      visual prominence to its triple rhetorical structures.</p>
    <p>Harvey and Spenser argue below about the metrics of this poem, so the following scansion must
      be regarded as especially uncertain:</p>

    <p>At 5.65-9 Harvey considers whether the last foot of the last line—‘merito’—should be
      scanned as an anapaest or a spondee, but he is disapprovingly confident that it cannot
      be iambic. For Harvey’s solution to the problem of the hypermetricality he attributes
      to 90/6, see 5.61-63 and 5.63n.</p>

    <p><mentioned><hi rend="italic">Ad Ornatissimum . . . reducat. etc.</hi></mentioned>: ‘To that most accomplished man and, for a long time, the
      most eminently renowned, G.H., the Farewell [<hi rend="italic">eutychein</hi>] of his Immerito, soon to make
      his voyage into Gaul.</p>
    <p>‘Thus the bad poet salutes the great one; thus the not unfriendly one, his friend; thus the
      novice, the veteran, and wishes him, now returned after many years, favorable skies, more
      favorable than those he himself now enjoys. Behold, the god—if indeed he really be a god who
      tempts the unyielding to wickedness and brings sworn love to ruin—behold, the sea god has
      now given me clear signs and, gentle, smooths his seas, soon to be furrowed by a
      sail-bearing bow; Father Aeolus also puts by his furies and the huge gusts of the North Wind:
      thus all things suit my passage.</p>
    <p>‘Only I am unsuited. For just now my mind, wounded by I know not what injury, is tossed by an
      uncertain sea, while Love, a powerful sailor, hauls here and there the powerless prow. Reason,
      that makes use of better counsel, and immortal honor have been split by Cupid’s fickle bow. We
      are anguished by this doubt, and shaken even while still at port. Oh, you who are now The
      Great Scorner of quiver-wearing Love (I pray that the gods not allow you that title
      unpunished) loosen these fetters and you will be, to me, The Great Apollo. A generous spirit,
      I know, drives you to the highest honors, and teaches the Poet to aspire more greatly.</p>
	  <p>‘How fickle is Love (and yet not all love is fickle). You therefore judge nothing equal to endless
      fame and, because of your sacred vision of such glory, you trample beneath you those other things
      that the senseless mob worships as gods—estates, friendships, city property, money, and whatever pleases the eyes,
      beauties, spectacles, lovers—like dirt and the mockeries of sense. 
      Surely this is a judgement worthy of my Harvey, worthy of the grand
      speaker and the noble heart; nor would the Stoic wisdom of the ancients fear to sanctify this
      judgement with eternal bonds. Yet for all that, tastes differ.</p>
    <p> ‘It is said that the eloquent son of feeble Laertes, however much driven across the seas
      beneath unknown skies, and however long an exile in an ocean stormy with whirlpools, refused
      those born of heaven and the blessed couch of the gods in favor of the embrace of a tearful
      spouse: so mighty was his love, and his wife, in fact, even mightier than Love himself. And yet you
      mock it; such is your boast. Compared with an enshadowed vision of such great splendor and a
      reputation born of famous merits, you despise all those other things that the senseless mob
      worships as gods—estates, friendships, herds, property, money, and whatever pleases the eyes—beauties, spectacles, lovers—whatever is pleasing to the tongue and to the ears. </p>
    <p>‘Indeed, fine as is your palate, taste is not wisdom: he who knows well how to be
      <hi rend="italic">un</hi>wise, often bears the palm away from arrogant wisemen. The harsh crowd of the Wise
      now mocks Aristippus for tempering mild words to the purple-robed tyrant; Aristippus mocks the
      empty precepts of the Wise, whom the merest shadow of a passing gnat could cruelly torment.
      And whoever strives to please great heroes, strives to be unwise, for rewards flood the
      foolish. All told, whoever hopes to glorify his brow with plaited laurel and to please a
      favorable crowd, strives, crazed, for unwisdom and seeks the degraded praise of shameful folly.
      Father Ennius was said to have been the only wise man in a numberless crowd, yet he is praised for
      having poured out songs drenched in lunatic wine. Nor, if one may say so, would you, the
      greatest Cato of our age, really deserve the sacred name of reverend Poet, no matter how
      gloriously you sing or how noble the song, unless you would wish to make a fool of yourself,
      for the world is full of fools.</p>
    <p>‘Yet a safe path remains in the midst of the whirlpool, for you should call wise only he who
      wishes to seem to the rest neither too foolish, nor too wise: here by a wave you would have
      drowned, and there been consumed by a fire. If you’re smart, don’t reject gushing delights
      outright, nor a mistress slow in responding to your vows, nor stolen gold: leave such pitiful
      scruples to the Curiuses and Fabriciuses, those pitiful men, once the grand honor of their age, but
      now the dishonor of our own. Don’t try too hard. Either extreme is full of reproach. The man
      who is really thus seasoned, if anyone is really seasoned thus, call him alone wise—even if
      Socrates would be unwilling to do so.</p> 
	  <p>‘One power makes men pious, another makes them
	    just, and still another makes their hearts both most prudent and brave, but ‘he <hi rend="italic">who mixes the useful and the
	      pleasant</hi> wins on every count’. The gods gave me the gift of the Pleasant long ago,
	    but they’ve never given me the Useful. Oh, if only they had given me, then, or even now, the Useful along
      with the Pleasant. If the gods didn’t so begrudge happiness to mortals, they could have
      granted me, at once, (since to the gods great things and small ones weigh equally) both the
      Pleasant <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the Useful. But your good Fortune is so great, that it gives you, equally,
      whatever is pleasant and, at pleasure, whatever is useful; while we, born under a harsh star,
      go off at length to seek our fortune through the inhospitable Caucasus, the rocky Pyrenees,
      and polluted Babylon. But if we shall not find there what we seek, having crossed a huge sea
      in endless wandering, we will seek it beyond, in the midst of the flood, in the company of
      Ulysses. Thenceforth with weary steps we will attend the grieving Goddess, for whom, seeking
      for that noble thing which was stolen, the world is bereft. For it shames the not too
      unluckily gifted youth, languishing in shameful darkness and in the paternal lap, vainly to
      waste his flourishing years on worthless tasks and to pick out only empty stalks, when fruits
      were hoped for.</p>
    <p>‘We will therefore set out at once (would anyone wish me good luck at the outset?); we will
      trudge with weary foot up the steep Alps. Who, meanwhile, who will send you little notes,
      spiced with British dews? and who will write the song goatish with love? Beneath the peak of
      the Oebalian mountain the unpracticed Muse in inexhaustible laments will bemoan her silence so
      protracted, and weeping will mourn sacred, silenced Helicon. Good Harvey, who can be
      dear to all, and deservedly so, since he is sweeter, almost, than all the rest, my Angel and
      Gabriel, however thronged by countless friends and pressed by delightful choirs of guardian
      spirits, will nevertheless often pine for an absent one, Immerito, and will wish, “if only my
      Edmund were here, who has written news, and has not kept silent about his own love affairs,
      and often prays, from his heart and with kind words, for my good fortune. May God
      eventually return him, etc.”’</p>

      lack of finish here is the poor continuity between the unusually short period at 145 (originally printed

    <p> [A generous spirit, I know, drives you to the highest honors, and teaches the Poet to aspire
      more greatly. How fickle is Love (and yet not all love is fickle). It is said that the
      eloquent son of feeble Laertes, however much driven across the seas beneath unknown skies, and
      however long an exile in an ocean stormy with whirlpools, refused those born of heaven and the
      blessed couch of the gods in favor of the embrace of a tearful spouse: so mighty was his love,
      and his wife, in fact, even mightier than Love himself. And yet you mock it; such is your boast.
      Compared with an enshadowed vision of such great splendor and a reputation born of famous
      merits, you despise all those other things that the senseless mob worships as gods—estates,
      friendships, herds, property, money, and whatever pleases the eyes—beauties,
      spectacles, lovers—whatever is pleasing to the tongue and to the ears. Indeed, fine as
      is your palate, taste is not wisdom:, etc.]

    <mentioned>thy . . . shorte</mentioned>: Harvey here infers Spenser’s position on
      particular quantities from the manifest evidence of ‘<q who="Spenser">Iambicum Trimetrum</q>’. (The sustained
      discussion of the rules governing syllable quantity unfolds in Letters 1-3, composed after
      Letters 4 and 5). While the relaxed rules of iambic trimeter make it difficult to ascertain
      what quantity Spenser assigns to almost <hi rend="italics">any</hi> syllable in the poem, there is some reason to
      believe that he regards ‘<q who="Spenser">thy</q>’—along with the first syllables of ‘<q who="Spenser">lying</q>’ and ‘<q who="Spenser">flying</q>’ as
      short: although substitutions are allowed, the expected second foot of most iambic metres,
      especially the second foot of the final metre in any given line, would be an iamb, and we find
      ‘<q who="Spenser">flying</q>’, ‘<q who="Spenser">fly forth</q>’, and ‘<q who="Spenser">lying</q>’ in such positions in 4.83, 4.84, and 4.85, which suggests
      that Spenser regards ‘fly’, ‘ly-’ and, by analogy, ‘thy’, as short. (The second foot of the
      poem’s final line ‘<q who="Spenser">I dye</q>’ might therefore seem to be an unallowable trochee, but the spelling
      of ‘dye’ may be meant to distinguish it from ‘fly’ and ‘thy’, so that we may regard this as a
      spondee.)

      there was another Paradise, of Fools, the wonderful Paradise of Lovers—Adam’s the one of the
      truly blessed, theirs of the fantastically and fanatically so. But of these
      things, more, perhaps, elsewhere. Believe me’.

    <mentioned>162-70</mentioned>: Whereas Spenser anticipated traveling as his Lord’s representative (‘<q who="Spenser">as sent by him</q>’, 4.238),
      Harvey here describes Leicester’s own preparations for travel. The transformative ‘<q who="Spenser">Lecture</q>’
      that Harvey is preparing will be in the art of <hi rend="italic">apodemica</hi>, which included the
      construction of itineraries, methods of observation while traveling, systems for questioning native informants, and
      for taking notes. Harvey refers here to two of the earliest contributions to what would become a
      large body of literature on the science of travel. The first is Hieronymo Turler’s <hi rend="italic">De
        peregrinatione</hi> (1574), which was translated into English as <hi rend="italic">The Traveiler</hi> in
      1575: Spenser himself gave Harvey a copy of the translation in 1578. The second is Theodor
      Zwinger’s <hi rend="italic">Methodus apodemica</hi> (1577), a much more systematic treatise heavily influenced
      by Peter Ramus, one of Harvey’s intellectual heroes. For a useful introduction to the form,
      see Howard 1914: ch. 2.

    <mentioned>Wherof I . . . other</mentioned>: Harvey’s praise of Leicester, that chief among the many goddesses and graces who guide him
      are the wise Minerva and the ingratiating Venus, contains an implicit apodemical theory, that
      the ideal traveler must combine the judiciousness, discipline, and prudence of the Minervan
      head and the amiable grace and courtesy of the Venereal body. It is worth noting that Harvey
      returns, quite self-consciously, to the technical philosophical vocabulary adopted earlier in
      the letter, at 32-3, signalling the return by means of the parenthesis, ‘<q who="Spenser">(I speake to a
      Logician)</q>’. Harvey’s reference to Leicester as an ‘<q who="Spenser">apt <hi rend="italic">subjecte</hi></q>’ [my emphasis]
      introduces one of the key terms in Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Categories</hi>: Aristotle devotes a section,
      Z.3, to the discussion of what a ‘subject’ (hypokeimenon) is and he defines it as ‘<q>that of
      which everything else is predicated</q>’ (1028b36), which makes it rather like what Aristotle
      refers to as a ‘primary substance’. At the end of the sentence, when Harvey speaks of ‘<q who="Spenser">the
      inseparable and indivisible accidents</q>’—Harvey seems to regard the two adjectives as synonyms—‘<q who="Spenser">of
      the foresaide Subject</q>’ he alludes to a ‘subtile’ logical distinction, introduced by
      Porphyry, in the understanding of accidents. In chapt. 3 of his <hi rend="italic">Isagoge</hi>, Porphyry
      distinguishes between separable and inseparable accidents, the latter being those accidents or
      features of individual subjects—like ‘the prudence of Leicester’s mind’ or ‘the grace of
      Leicester’s body’—that seem to inhere in it at all times—in Leicester’s case, abroad or at
      home—yet seem not to be essential to those subjects. The ‘inseparable accident’ is something
      of a boundary case, for one might challenge whether it is indeed accidental, asking, ‘If
      Leicester’s mind is always prudent and his body always graceful are grace and prudence not
      more than accidental? Are they not substantial, constitutive of his mind and body?’ Harvey’s
      philosophic usage is not very fastidious, although it allows him an alternative to a sociable
      mythographic register in which Leicester is accompanied by goddesses; in Harvey’s flattering
      philosophical register Leicester’s remarkable characteristics are evoked mysteriously, as both
      intellectually separable and also intrinsic.
