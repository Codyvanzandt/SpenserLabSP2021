        <p>The first of four prefatory materials to the 1579 quarto edition of <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes Calender</hi>, the title page is important as an
            object in its own right. It divides into four parts, from top to bottom: the
        title of the book; its dedication; the printer&#8217;s ornament; and the printer&#8217;s imprint.
        Distinctly missing is a printer&#8217;s border (around the edges), which distinguishes this title
        page from those in later <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> editions, and which gives the page a
        striking plainness for a book self-consciously announcing its importance (cf. Luborsky 1980:
        32-3). The name of the author is missing as well, for the book remains anonymous, signed on
        the next page by &#8216;Immerit&#244;&#8217; (The Unworthy One). Yet two other names do appear: that of
        Philip Sidney, the book&#8217;s dedicatee, marking the first appearance of this figure in
        Spenser&#8217;s biography and canon; and that of Hugh Singleton, the printer.</p> </note>

        <mentioned>The Shepheardes Calender</mentioned>: The title of Spenser&#8217;s book communicates a
        double message: on the one hand, the title aligns the book with the tradition of the English
        almanac; on the other, it aligns the book with the tradition of European pastoral, as
        signaled by the word &#8216;&#198;glogues&#8217; in the subtitle (see Introduction). Early modern punctuation
        allows for &#8216;Shepheardes&#8217; to be either possessive singular (shepherd&#8217;s) or plural
        (shepherds&#8217;), and arguments can be made for both (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 235). One
        recent modernized edition opts for the plural, &#8216;<hi rend="italics">The Shepherds&#8217;
            Calendar</hi>&#8217; (Brooks-Davies 1995: 7), which emphasizes the poem&#8217;s community of
        shepherds. One of the recognized models for the design of Spenser&#8217;s book also uses the
        plural: <hi rend="italics">The Kalender of Shepherdes</hi> (1^st^ edition 1506; reprinted
        nearly annually throughout sixteenth century), which E.K. refers to in his dedicatory
        Epistle. Yet <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> begins with reference to &#8216;A shepeheards boy&#8217;
        (1), and Immerito recurrently features his own personal possessiveness (e.g., &#8216;I have made a
        Calender&#8217; [Epilogue 1]), suggesting that the title straddles the divide of individual and
        communal production: this is a book about a community of shepherds <hi rend="italics">and</hi> an individual shepherd&#8217;s representation of that community (even as it is a
        representation of his alienation from that community). </note>

        In 1579, Sidney was a Gentleman (rather than a Knight) and descended from the noble Dudley
        family on his mother&#8217;s side, his uncle being Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. Spenser may

        <mentioned><hi rend="italics">Hugh Singleton</hi></mentioned>: A bookseller, printer, and
        bookbinder who worked in London between 1548 and 1593 at the sign of the Golden Tun in
        Creede Lane (as the imprint records). Only a few months before publication of <hi rend="italics">SC</hi>, Singleton had printed John Stubbes&#8217; <hi rend="italics">The
            Discoverie of a Gaping Gulf whereinto England is likely to be Swallowed</hi>, a
        polemical indictment of the proposed wedding match between Queen Elizabeth and the French
        Duc d&#8217;Alen&#231;on, a publication that infamously cost Stubbes his right hand. Singleton was also
        found guilty and ordered to lose his hand but later was pardoned, almost certainly because a
        printer had less responsibility than a publisher (in this case, the publisher, William Page,
        did lose his hand). Singleton&#8217;s role as the printer of <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> has
        political and religious significance, because he is associated not simply with the
        Leicester-Sidney faction mounting the attack on the queen&#8217;s wedding match but also with the
        Protestant reform movement circulating around this faction (Norbrook 2002: 63, 67; S.K.

        <p>The poem serving as a prologue to <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes
                Calender</hi>, &#8216;To His Booke,&#8217; appears on the verso of the title page in the early
            quartos. The two pages have a close relationship, because they both refer to Philip
            Sidney: the title page dedicates the book to Sidney, while the prologue
        refers to him as &#8216;the president / Of noblesse and of chevalree&#8217; (3-4). From the outset,
        Spenser features the relationship between author and patron, poetry and patronage, creating
        a specific professional frame for the reception of his book. Yet nowhere does Spenser reveal
        his own name, instead calling the author &#8216;Immerito&#8217; (&#8216;The Unworthy One&#8217;) at the foot of the
        prologue. In the fiction of the prologue, however, Immerito makes a sustained address to his
        &#8216;booke&#8217;, which introduces a second relationship, between author and work. Together, the two
        fictions present the author telling his book to go to Sidney for protection. </p>
        <p>The book needs protection for three reasons. First, as an orphan &#8216;whose parent is
            unkent&#8217; (unknown) (2)--Spenser is making his first formal appearance in print and wishes
            to remain anonymous--the book requires someone in a position of power to provide
            &#8216;succoure&#8217; for it (6). Second, since the book boldly appears in print while being so
            vulnerable, it needs defense against the &#8216;Envie&#8217; that will &#8216;barke&#8217; at it (5). And third,
            because the book is &#8216;base begot with blame&#8217;, and thus &#8216;takest shame&#8217; for its low-class
            status (14-15), it needs a higher-ranking member of society to license its authority.
            Immerito relies on the modesty topos, calling his enterprise &#8216;hardyhedde&#8217;, or arrogant
            presumption, but the word also draws attention to Spenser&#8217;s bold ambition:
        someone who had been a &#8216;sizar&#8217; or poor scholar at Cambridge University now publishes a book
        dedicated to a &#8216;noble&#8217; man of letters. </p>
        <p>Beneath the mask of modesty is not just Spenser&#8217;s social mobility but the very
            grounds for it: an eighteen-line debut poem in tetrameter tercets&#8212;a rare if
        not original verse form in itself&#8212;which relies on such unusual and sophisticated devices for
        the time as recurrent enjambment, neologism, lucid and polysyllabic diction, and learned
        allusion to biblical, classical, and native medieval works, all of which command authority.
        For instance, Immerito asks Sidney for protection &#8216;Under the shadow of his wing&#8217; (7), a
        phrase borrowed from Psalms 36.7, identifying the English patron with the Israelite David,
        the shepherd-king who protects his flock with faithful song. Yet the prologue opens with a
        clear imitation of a native author, Chaucer, who had placed an address to his work toward
        the end of <hi rend="italics">Troilus and Criseyde</hi>: &#8216;Go, litel bok, go, litel myn
        tragedye&#8217; (5.1786). Immerito repeats the words of England&#8217;s greatest poet of the past and
        aims to overgo him. Chaucer&#8217;s address had a healthy afterlife in English poetry, including
        Lydgate&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Troy Book</hi> and Skelton&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Garland or
            Chaplet of Laurel</hi> (see note below). Yet none of these three native precursors
        formally wrote in pastoral, so scholars have also found Spenser imitating Virgil: &#8216;A
        shepheards swaine say did thee sing / All as his straying flocke he fedde&#8217; (9-10). Here,
        Spenser scripts a deft accommodation of a classical to a biblical trope for the Christian
        poet&#8217;s saving pastoral art. For those who look to Virgil as a model, pastoral anticipates
        epic. Hence, Immerito gestures to the Virgilian progression of literary forms when
        identifying Sidney as &#8216;the president / Of noblesse and of chevalree&#8217;: not just the patron
        but the exemplar of heroic culture and art. Immerito&#8217;s concluding lines also gesture to
        future poems: &#8216;Come tell me, what was sayd of mee: / And I will send more after thee&#8217;
        (17-8). Finally, Immerito&#8217;s interest in his own reputation emerges in line 13 when he raises
        the prospect that Sidney might wish to &#8216;aske&#8217; the author his &#8216;name&#8217;, providing a glimpse
        into one of Spenser&#8217;s singular preoccupations: fame. Here, also, Spenser bids for an ongoing
        personal relationship with his patron, mediated by the book they share. </p>
        <p>For its metrical and formal innovations, its generic representations, its social, political,
        and religious topics, and finally its fiction of authorship, patronage, social reception,
        and renown, &#8216;To His Booke&#8217; opens the page of Spenser&#8217;s &#8216;Calender&#8217; to a remarkable index of
        literary ambition and achievement. </p></note>

        the dedicatory Epistle to Gabriel Harvey is an important document in English letters. Above
        all, it boldly introduces the author of the pastoral book as the &#8216;new Poete&#8217; (dedication
        title)&#8212;a phrase that continues to be associated with Spenser over 400 years later. </p>
        <p>The Epistle divides into several topics: the New Poet&#8217;s relation with
        Chaucer and Virgil and a prediction of the author&#8217;s fame (1-14); his groundbreaking use of
        language--both his individual words (23-95) and his sentence arrangement (96-111)--to
        advance the &#8216;Mother tonge&#8217; (70), including his triumphant overgoing of &#8216;the rakehellye route
        of our ragged rymers&#8217; (102-3); the program of an author who begins the &#8216;flyght&#8217; (123) of his
        career with pastoral, in imitation of Virgil and other poets (112-36); the poet&#8217;s &#8216;purpose&#8217;
        (137) in writing <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> (137-61), &#8216;to mitigate and allay the heate of
        his passion, or else to warne . . . young shepheards . . . of his unfortunate folly&#8217;
        (140-2); and the evocation of a literary environment in which the book is produced,
        including its relation to Harvey, Philip Sidney (the book&#8217;s dedicatee), and the mysterious
        E.K., who signs the Epistle (162-93).</p>
        <p>Probably, E.K. does not refer to Edward Kirke (1553-1613), who had been a sizar
            with Spenser at Cambridge, even though Kirke&#8217;s initials match E.K.&#8217;s and Spenser
            mentions &#8216;Mystress Kerke&#8217; (either Edward&#8217;s mother or his wife) in a letter to Harvey
            written on 16 October 1579 (<hi rend="italics">Letters</hi> 4.63, 257-8; see Hadfield
            2012: 122-3). More likely, Spenser authored the Epistle himself, as well as
        the General Argument, the prose Arguments prefacing the twelve eclogues, and their detailed
        glosses, perhaps in collusion with Harvey (Starnes 1944; Schleiner 1990; Waldman 1991;
        Carroll 2005; McCabe 2010: 465-8). Consequently, readers may more profitably turn away from
        this &#8216;authorial wild goose chase&#8217; to &#8216;question the purpose and nature of [E.K.&#8217;s] . . .
        strange exegetical performance&#8217; (Kearney 2011: 143n2). In his performance, E.K. functions as
        part of Spenser&#8217;s elaborate fiction about his monumental book (McCanles 1982): not merely
        does E.K. serve as the presenter of Spenser&#8217;s literary career but he functions as a
        &#8216;diagnostic and analytic . . . commentary on, and exploration of, the place of such books in
        his culture&#8217; (Kearney 2011: 114).</p>
        <p>As both performance and prolegomenon, the Epistle is important in a history of
            the book and of English literature (cf. Tribble 1993: 72-87; Slights 2001:
        46-52; Cook 2011). </p></note>

        Hall, Cambridge during Spenser&#8217;s residence, as well as his close friend and his

        Latin secretary to Alfonso V of Aragon, and who, in <hi rend="italics">Emendationes in
            Livium de Bello Punico</hi> (1532, 1540), criticized Livy for relying on his Paduan
        dialect. Titus Livius was a Roman historian (59 BC-AD 17), author of <hi rend="italics">The
            History of Rome</hi>. Caius Sallustius Crispus (86-<hi rend="italics">c</hi>. 34 BC) was
        also a Roman historian, author of <hi rend="italics">The Conspiracy of</hi>
        <hi rend="italics">Catiline</hi> and <hi rend="italics">The Jugurthine War</hi> whose
        penchant for archaism had been attacked most recently by Roger Ascham (<hi rend="italics">c</hi>. 1515-1568) in <hi rend="italics">The Scholemaster</hi> (1570). Ascham, in 1579
        the recently deceased tutor to Queen Elizabeth, may well be E.K.&#8217;s anonymous &#8216;other&#8217;
        (Maclean and Prescott suggest Sir John Cheke [1514-1547], tutor to Edward VI [1993: 502]).
        Livy and Sallust join Cicero (&#8216;that worthy Oratour&#8217;, mentioned by name subsequently) as
        Roman republicans who oppose monarchy. In being of the &#8216;opinion&#8217; that &#8216;auncient solemne
        wordes are a great ornament&#8217;, E.K. sides with Livy and Sallust: &#8216;the one&#8217; (E.K. continues)
        &#8216;labouring to set forth in hys worke an eternall image of antiquitie, and the other
        carefully discoursing matters of gravitie and importaunce&#8217; (43-4). Significantly, the
        &#8216;eternall image of antiquitie&#8217; that E.K. finds in Livy is a history of the Roman Republic.
        Livy, Sallust, and especially Cicero are important for defining a republic as relating a
        &#8216;free person&#8217; to a &#8216;free state&#8217;: &#8216;Like a free person, a free state is one that is able to
        act according to its own will&#8217; (Skinner 2002: 2.301). Spenser would have started studying

        An important metaphor of authorship, linking imitation with interpretation, the poet&#8217;s
        following in the footsteps of other poets and the reader tracking these literary
        maneuverings. The pun on metrical foot clarifies what lies behind the idea of following
        someone&#8217;s footsteps: the hunt, a form of competition, which extends to the reader, who
        traces the author&#8217;s tracking of other authors. (On the pun, see Hinds 1987: 16, citing
        Catullus, <hi rend="italics">Odes</hi> 14.21-3; Horace, <hi rend="italics">Ars Poetica</hi>
        80; Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Met</hi> 5.264, <hi rend="italics">Am</hi> 3.1.8, <hi rend="italics">Tr</hi> 1.115-16. Origins lie in Lucretius, <hi rend="italics">DRN</hi>
        1.404-09. On the &#8216;image of tracking the deer as an analogy for interpretation&#8217; being &#8216;a
        typically Stoic conception&#8217;, see Pugh 2005: 79.) Spenser elsewhere uses the hunt as a trope
        for authorship (e.g., <hi rend="italics">Letters</hi> 1.58-60). Sometimes he does not make
        the hunt explicit in his travel metaphor: Epilogue 11 (see note; on the link between the two
        metaphors, and on the meaning of &#8216;trace&#8217; as hunt, see Bates 2013, chapter 1, citing E.K.&#8217;s

        Proposals for reform of the Julian calendar were already circulating. The Gregorian calendar
        (named after Pope Gregory XIII [1502-1585], who was Pope when <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> was
        published) was widely adopted in 1582, but not in England until 1752, because of its papal
        associations: &#8216;The calendar was being contested in two ways in early modern England. First,
        in 1577, Pope Gregory had proposed eliminating ten days from the calendar in order to make
        it conform more exactly to celestial motions,&#8217; provoking Protestant resistance. &#8216;Second, . .
        . was the argument over the calendar&#8217;s liturgical content,&#8217; with &#8216;many English reformers
        object[ing] . . . to the Catholic calendar&#8217;s large number of holy days and denounce[ing] . .
        . its &#8220;idolatrous&#8221; canon of saints. . . . Spenser&#8217;s text intervenes in both of these
        calendar debates&#8217;: first, &#8216;Spenser . . . construct[s] . . . a specifically English calendar
        &#8220;untainted&#8221; by Catholic forms of time reckoning&#8217;; second, he &#8216;symbolically remakes the
        Catholic liturgical calendar by substituting local English figures for the traditional
        calendar of saints, thus bringing a pointedly English history into the patterning of sacred
        time&#8217; (Chapman 2002: 3). </note>

        The first eclogue of <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes Calender</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> is also the first to
            feature Colin Clout, Spenser&#8217;s chief persona. The eclogue especially pairs with the
            sixth and twelfth eclogues, <hi rend="italics">June</hi> and <hi rend="italics">December</hi>, where Colin again appears as a speaker;
            but it aligns with the fourth and eighth, <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> and <hi rend="italics">August</hi>, where others rehearse
            Colin&#8217;s songs. This structure gives the <hi rend="italics">Calender</hi> a formal symmetry focusing on the
            poet&#8217;s developing career. The central theme of <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> is the poet&#8217;s inability to
            produce his art under the pressure of unrequited love, narrated in the key event at the
            end: after his beloved, Rosalind, rejects him, Colin breaks his pipe.
         </p>
    <p>
        The eclogue divides into three parts. In lines 1-12, a third-person narrator
            (presumably Immerito, named as the author of &#8216;To His Booke&#8217;) describes Colin leading his
            emaciated flock from their winter pens into the sun, and then identifies the shepherd as
            an artist-figure: &#8216;Well couth he tune his pipe, and frame his stile&#8217; (10).
        Then, in lines 13-71 Colin sings a ten-stanza complaint addressed to various figures in the
        natural world&#8212;the Gods and Pan, the barren ground, the naked trees, his feeble flock&#8212;before
        recalling how his sight of Rosalind debilitated his art, and he asks Pan for pity. Finally,
        in lines 72-8 the narrator records how Colin breaks his pipe and lies down, until nighttime
        rouses him to take his sheep home. Ingeniously, Spenser deploys a single six-line stanza in
        iambic pentameter, rhyming <hi rend="italics">ababcc</hi> (a sixain), to record the voices of both narrator and
        persona, drawing attention to their interconnectedness.
        </p>
    <p>
        In focusing on the relation between poetry and desire, the eclogue weds the
            genres of Virgilian pastoral and Petrarchan lyric, dressing Virgil&#8217;s classical shepherd
            in the guise of the continental Renaissance lover (and the Renaissance lover in that of
            a classical shepherd). The key source-texts for Colin&#8217;s complaint are Virgil&#8217;s Eclogue
            2, which tells of Corydon&#8217;s frustrated desire for the shepherd-boy Alexis; and
            Petrarch&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Rima Sparse</hi> 66, which tells of Petrarch&#8217;s turn to the natural world to
            contend with his frustrated desire over Laura (cf. <hi rend="italics">Jan</hi> 63-6n). Consequently, the topic
            of male friendship intersects with that of male-female sexuality: Colin
        takes the &#8216;clownish gifts&#8217; (57) given to him by Hobbinol and &#8216;gives [them] to Rosalind
        againe&#8217; (60). E.K.&#8217;s gloss on Colin&#8217;s rejection of Hobbinol in favor of Rosalind, which
        refers to &#8216;some savour of disorderly love, which the learned call paederastice&#8217;, evokes a
        longstanding Western conversation about gender identity, despite E.K.&#8217;s insistence that this
        issue is &#8216;gathered beside his [the author&#8217;s] meaning&#8217; (59 [Goldberg 1990]). The dynamic of
        adolescent male friendship and traumatic heterosexual desire forms the social dynamic within
        which Colin produces his youthful art; it is within this dynamic that Rosalind &#8216;scorne[s]&#8217;
        his &#8216;rurall musick&#8217;: &#8216;Shepheards deuise she hateth as the snake&#8217; (64-5).
         </p>
    <p>
        The shortest of the twelve eclogues at 78 lines, <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi>
            nonetheless raises important questions at the outset about Spenser&#8217;s presentation of his
            persona. Does Spenser criticize Colin as a &#8216;failure&#8217;, because the shepherd both
            misgoverns his sheep (Durr 1957: 71) and locates his faith in the world of
        nature--represented by his invocation of Pan, a pagan nature god--rather than in divine
        grace (MacCaffrey 1969: 121-2; Moore, 1975)? Or does Spenser focus less on Colin&#8217;s religious
        faith and ethical action in society and more on poetry itself, whether Colin&#8217;s use of poetic
        song to form a human art operative in the world (Alpers 1972: 353, 362) or a narcissistic
        song of misplaced artistic ambition (Berger 1988: 325-46)? By raising such questions, <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> sets the problem that the rest of <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> will take on: the role of erotic social courtship (Montrose 1979) in the
        personal religious faith that underwrites the poet&#8217;s public art (P. Cheney 1993: 77-110,
        2001: 79). Rosalind&#8217;s judgment that Colin&#8217;s youthful art is snakelike is especially damning,
        intimating that Spenser here represents an immature poetry that is dangerous, deceptive, and
        demonic, particularly with respect to female integrity. </p>
    <p>
        Curiously, E.K.&#8217;s glosses provide a different, or complementary, lens&#8212;not
            strictly artistic, erotic, religious, or ethical but political. E.K.&#8217;s references to Sir
            Thomas Smith&#8217;s (1513-77) treatise on English government, <hi rend="italics">De Republica Anglorum</hi> (written
            1562-5; published 1583), to John Skelton&#8217;s biting satires against Henry VIII&#8217;s chief
            advisor, Cardinal Wolsey, and to Cl&#233;ment Marot, France&#8217;s Protestant poet of exile, speak
            to the poem&#8217;s political agenda. This agenda emerges in such resonant phrasing about
            Colin&#8217;s shepherding as &#8216;ill government&#8217; (45 and note): in the late 1570s,
        Spenser joins the Leicester-Sidney circle in its disaffection from Queen Elizabeth and her
        proposed marriage to the French Catholic Duc d&#8217;Alen&#231;on (McCabe 1999: 520; Pugh 2016: 86, 98, 110).
         </p>
    <p>
        The woodcut, the most individualized of the twelve, reverses the trajectory of
            the poet&#8217;s &#8216;failure&#8217; in the eclogue narrative (cf. Luborksy 1981: 24-9;
        Patterson 1987: 123-4). Colin stands near the center, a broken bagpipe at his feet
        (symbolizing the art of frustrated desire), in the shadow of a tree (symbolizing Virgilian
        royal patronage from Eclogue 1). Colin&#8217;s disorganized sheep graze behind him, and behind
        them stands a house, perhaps the shepherd&#8217;s, or perhaps Rosalind&#8217;s (see <hi rend="italics">Aug</hi> 161, 181). Yet
        Colin faces away from this pastoral scene, toward a hilltop city, marked as Rome by the
        pointed towers and the Colosseum, in an evocation (at once clear and clashing) of the
        Virgilian and even Petrarchan poet who writes pastoral beckoning to epic.
         </p>
    <p>
        <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi>, then, is important for its complex narrative evoking questions about
            the power of desire (erotic and ethical, political and religious) to affect the role of
            the poet in England during the late 1570s (cf. L.S. Johnson 1990: 104-14;
        Kinney 2010).

        <mentioned>Colin cloute</mentioned>: Spenser&#8217;s most recognizable name for his poetic
        persona, who reappears in <hi rend="italics">Colin Clout</hi> and <hi rend="italics">FQ</hi>
        VI.ix-x, is mentioned at <hi rend="italics">Time</hi> 225, <hi rend="italics">Daph</hi> 229,
        and <hi rend="italics">TCM</hi> VII.vi.40.5, and is the name by which he was known to
        contemporaries (e.g., Drayton, <hi rend="italics">Shepheards Garland</hi> [1593], Eclogue
        3.12-4). The name Colin derives from L <hi rend="italics">colonus</hi> &#8216;farmer&#8217; and was
        associated with lower-class rustics, while the word &#8216;clout&#8217; could mean piece of cloth, esp.
        a rag, but also a clod of earth. Thus the full name identifies Spenser&#8217;s persona as a
        spokesman for the common man, or populace, and was used as such by Skelton. In the
        anticlerical poem <hi rend="italics">Collyn Clout</hi>, Skelton uses Collyn to attack
        Cardinal Wolsey at the court of Henry VIII for clerical abuse, presenting the title figure
        as a prophetic poet with a plain-speaking voice. Subsequently, the name &#8216;Colin Clout&#8217; came
        to evoke &#8216;an entire tradition of Reformist literature&#8217; (Griffiths 2006: 167). Marot also
        introduces a pastoral speaker named Colin in <hi rend="italics">Eglogue de ma Dame Loyse de
            Savoye</hi>, a funeral elegy on the mother of Francis I and a major source-text for <hi rend="italics">November</hi> (see headnote and note on &#8216;Marot&#8217; in the Arg). Finally, as
        E.K. points out in his gloss, the idea of an authorial pastoral persona traces to antiquity,
        and principally to Virgil&#8217;s Tityrus in <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 1 and 6.
        Importantly, however, the name Colin Clout is one of &#8216;eleven speakers in <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes Calender</hi>&#8217; but &#8216;not one has a classical name&#8217; (A. Fowler 2012: 34). </note>

        Rose</hi>). Rosalinde&#8217;s name appears in six eclogues (<hi rend="italics">Jan</hi> 60, <hi rend="italics">Apr</hi> 27, <hi rend="italics">June</hi> 44, 115, <hi rend="italics">Aug</hi> 141, <hi rend="italics">Nov</hi> 44, <hi rend="italics">Dec</hi> 113, 156) and
        in <hi rend="italics">Colin Clout</hi> (908, 926), but she herself never appears as a
        character inside the fiction. As E.K.&#8217;s gloss makes clear, the name is a pseudonym designed
        to conceal Rosalind&#8217;s real-life identity; speculations include Spenser&#8217;s first wife,
        Machabyas Childe, Mary Sidney Herbert, and even Queen Elizabeth (<hi rend="italics">SpE</hi>

<note target="#calender_february_headnote" type="headnote" n="">
        <p><hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi> is notable for its verse achievement in poetic
            narrative. In 1586, William Webbe first admired the &#8216;Sheepeheardes homelyst talke&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 253), and the admiration continued in the
        eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, with William Hazlitt calling the inset
        fable of the Oak and the Briar &#8216;as splendid a piece of oratory as any found in the records
        of the eloquence of the British senate&#8217; (Friedland 1954: 224). Yet Hazlitt&#8217;s political
        metaphor from the Roman Republic also speaks to the particular way that Spenser harnesses
        poetic eloquence here: on behalf of a &#8216;British&#8217; nation committed to free debate. </p>
    <p>
        Spenser&#8217;s oratory divides into three parts: 1) lines 1-101 feature a
        sometimes rancorous debate between the younger shepherd Cuddie and the older Thenot on the
        topic of youth and age; 2) lines 102-238 present Thenot telling Cuddie a fable of the Oak
        and the Briar about the arrogance of youth undercutting the authority of age, only to
        destroy itself; and 3) lines 239-46 show Cuddie&#8217;s biting rejection of the moral utility of
        Thenot&#8217;s fable. </p>
    <p>
        To accomplish such a &#8216;homely&#8217; narrative, Spenser relies on rugged tetrameter couplets with
        an often coarse and archaic diction. The lines vary from eight to ten syllables, and the
        baseline iambic meter frequently modulates through anapests (two unstressed syllables
        followed by a stressed one). By writing so many lines having four beats with stresses
        tending to fall on the heavy alliteration, the poet evokes the medieval tradition of <hi rend="italics">Piers Plowman</hi> and the pseudo-Chaucerian <hi rend="italics">Plowman&#8217;s
            Tale</hi>, important to the Protestant reform movement. This helps explain the first
        appearance in <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> of &#8216;Tityrus&#8217;, the shepherd whom Thenot cites as the
        inventor of the fable, and whom Cuddie admires, bringing to their rancor an unusual moment
        of accord. Tityrus, we learn, is Chaucer, and the reference allows <hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi> to record Spenser&#8217;s own budding genealogy as England&#8217;s national poet. </p>
    <p>
        The shepherds&#8217; debate evokes several controversies taking place in
            mid-Elizabethan culture: about the relative merits of youth and age (Cullen
        1970: 34-41); about court patronage, in which warring factions at the Elizabethan court vie
        for power, the younger generation vying for authority with the older one (Hoffman 1978:
        92-7; Montrose 1981; Bond 1981; Patterson 1991: 59-61, 88-9); about Protestant attacks on
        both older Catholic faith and younger Protestant radicalism (Hume 1984: 43-4; J.N. King
        1990: 34); and about opposing Elizabethan poetics (Berger 1988: 425; Halpern 1991: 176-214;
        Pugh 2005: 30-4), including the two major poetics of the 1570s: Cuddie&#8217;s courtly &#8216;amateur&#8217;
        art, which features delightful love stories without an ethical end; and Thenot&#8217;s older
        &#8216;humanist&#8217; art, which insists on moral instruction (P. Cheney 2002). Not just good
        storytelling, <hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi> packs in a wide cultural conversation. </p>
    <p>
        The central precursor text for the eclogue&#8217;s showpiece, the fable of the Oak and
            the Briar, is Aesop&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">The Bush and the Aubyer</hi>, in which a tree
            persuades a woodsman to cut down a rival tree, although Spenser superimposes onto this a
            poem from the reign of Edward VI, <hi rend="italics">The Hospitable Oake</hi>, which
            uses Virgilian allusions to represent powerful patrons as vulnerable shade trees
            (Patterson 1991: 60-1). Yet in the background is likely Gascoigne&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Princely Pleasures of Kenilworth Castle</hi> (1576), in which Queen
        Complacida (she who pleases everyone) metamorphoses an oak of Constancy and a briar of
        Contention (Friedland 1954; Watson 1993), in an allegory featuring Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s
        favoring of the earl of Leicester, patron of Gascoigne (and later, Spenser). Perhaps also
        applicable is the first fable in <hi rend="italics">The Seven Ages of Rome</hi>, a medieval
        romance popular in the sixteenth century (Roberts 1950). These subtexts gesture to the
        social, political, and religious issues resonating in <hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi>. </p>
    <p>
        The woodcut is impressively done, and gestures to these issues as well, with the
            two debating shepherds standing in the center, their hands nearly touching in accord,
            balanced by their flocks standing behind them (Thenot, sheep; Cuddie, bullocks). To the
            right, behind Cuddie, are the emblems of the fable: a husbandman cutting
        down a tall tree, with a briar standing in its shadow&#8212;curiously being eaten by one of the
        bullocks. To the left, behind Thenot, are buildings that evoke the institutions of church
        and state. </p>
    <p>
        Both the content of <hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi> and its archaic prosody link it with
        the ecclesiastical eclogues, <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi>,
        and <hi rend="italics">September</hi>, and, together with <hi rend="italics">October</hi>,
        they form what E.K. calls the &#8216;moral&#8217; eclogues (see note below on Arg &#8216;morall&#8217;). Moreover,
            <hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi> stands out from the eclogue it follows, <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi>, which has featured a smoother poetic surface and a solo
        artist, Colin Clout. Not merely splendid narrative, <hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi> is
        among the most sophisticated of the eclogues, relying self-consciously on rugged poetic
        meter to air&#8212;rather than simply &#8216;moralize&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">FQ</hi> I.pr.1.9)--social,
        religious, political, and finally poetic debates. Indeed, Spenser&#8217;s ability to contain
        cultural debate within a verse narrative that manages to balance resonance with restraint
        demonstrates his emerging authority as a leading voice in &#8216;the British senate&#8217;. </p>

        represent the earl of Leicester, the Briar the earl of Oxford, and the Husbandman Elizabeth
        (McLane 1961), but such simplistic identifications seem less compelling than more general
        allusions to generational disputes between older and younger courtiers, although the

    <p>
        <hi rend="italics">March</hi> is unusual for its attempt to &#8216;English&#8217; the
            classical (and continental) pastoral of Cupid: the eclogue takes an ancient
        tradition of eros and brings it home to the English countryside. In particular, the eclogue
        divides its fiction into two symmetrical parts: in lines 1-60, two young shepherds, Willye
        and Thomalin, discuss the nature of erotic desire; and in lines 61-117 Thomalin tells the
        story of his encounter with Cupid, god of love, who has wounded him in the Achilles&#8217; heel,
        while Willye recalls the story of his father, who also encounters the deity. </p>
    <p>
        The topic of the eclogue, adolescent boys awakening to sexual desire, conjoins with <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi>, the story of Colin Clout&#8217;s youthful unrequited love for
        Rosalind, and with <hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi>, with its eclogue structure divided
        between a dialogue and a fable. <hi rend="italics">March</hi> also anticipates <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi>, with its springtime topicality evoking the predicament of
        Queen Elizabeth contemplating a marriage with the French Duc d&#8217;Alen&#231;on. </p>
    <p>
        Spenser&#8217;s attempt to naturalize the originary erotic classical myth on English
            soil shows him engaging in an ancient topic, however successful artistically (cf. Bush,
                <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 268 versus Palgrave, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 266-7). Specifically, Spenser rewrites Bion&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Idylls</hi> 4 and Ronsard&#8217;s 1556 ode, <hi rend="italics">L&#8217;Amour oiseau</hi> (Spitzer
        1950), the two key precursor texts (Spenser may have known Bion through Angelo Poliziano&#8217;s
        1512 Latin translation). Bion tells how, one day, the boy Ixeutas goes out hunting for
        birds, only to encounter Eros. Shooting all his arrows but missing the god, the boy turns to
        an old ploughman, who had taught him the art of hunting in the first place: the tutor
        counsels patience, for one day the god will return to hunt <hi rend="italics">him</hi>.
        Ronsard adapts the story to emphasize both the beauty of the winged god and the pessimism of
        the tutor, an old fortuneteller, in a narrative design that features the simple disparity
        between innocence and experience. Spenser, in contrast, shows two boys actually experiencing
        desire, and talking about it, free of the interference of adult wisdom. </p>
    <p>
        <hi rend="italics">March</hi> thus constitutes &#8216;an inimitable <hi rend="italics">poetic description of puberty</hi>&#8217; (Sptizer 1950: 499), a phrase that
        usefully sustains both erotic and poetic valence. On the one hand, the eclogue offers &#8216;a
        comic portrayal of man&#8217;s initiation and perennial re-initiation into the sexual rites of
        spring&#8217; (Cullen 1970: 100), in which &#8216;Adolescent psychology and budding eroticism are
        Spenser&#8217;s interests&#8217; (Hoffman 1977: 82). On the other, the eclogue&#8217;s spring landscape refers
        &#8216;primarily to the <hi rend="italics">topoi</hi> and symbols of previous literature and only
        secondarily to objects and figures in &#8220;nature&#8221;&#8217;: &#8216;the intent is to imitate and signify
        poetry&#8217;&#8212;specifically, to undercut &#8216;the wisdom of the literary elders, their vision of love
        as folly&#8217;, and to &#8216;show . . . what is wrong with it&#8217; (Berger 1988: 364, 370). </p>
    <p>
        The seemingly light-hearted eclogue also has political significance, exposed
            briefly in the curious reference to the shepherdess &#8216;Lettice&#8217; in line 20, alluding to
            the earl of Leicester&#8217;s secret marriage to Lettice Knollys, which angered the queen (see
            Hadfield 2012: 128-31); and in the spelling of &#8216;gall&#8217; in Thomalin&#8217;s emblem,
        &#8216;Gaule&#8217; (France), punning on the bitterness of her proposed French marriage. Perhaps the
        eclogue also evokes the politics of desire in lines 49-50 in the image of an &#8216;Unhappye Ewe&#8217;
        wearing a &#8216;clout&#8217; (or bandage) on her &#8216;legge&#8217; and falling &#8216;headlong into a dell&#8217; (see
        comment below on line 50). Using such &#8216;markes and tokens&#8217; (as E.K. calls them in the
        Argument), the eclogue creates a tension between a simple narrative surface in which boys
        talk about sex and the depth of an intertext that analyzes an entire tradition of love--all
        situated within international court politics. Yet the handling of the allusions in this
        eclogue is especially deft: the reader is constantly being made aware of contexts that
        remain outside the awareness of the speakers, teased by a sense that their topic exceeds
        their still childish grasp. The deliberately naive and toylike quality of the verse and
        fable do much to exclude the contexts that the allusions evoke. </p>
    <p>
        To accomplish this maneuver, Spenser uses a version of &#8216;tail-rhyme&#8217;:
        a six-line stanza, rhyming <hi rend="italics">aabccb</hi>, which divides into two units,
        each consisting of three lines (a tetrameter couplet followed by a single trimeter line),
        with both units using the same &#8216;b&#8217; rhyme. Although Spenser begins by assigning each shepherd
        a six-line speech, he goes on to efface this stanzaic design. Willye&#8217;s second speech, for
        instance, consists of a single twelve-line stanza, while Thomalin&#8217;s second speech consists
        of just three lines, with his tale being a single forty-two line stanza. Paradoxically, <hi rend="italics">March</hi> uses an idyllic-sounding representation of youthful spring
        desire to present a &#8216;somewhat sour&#8217; attitude toward &#8216;love&#8217; (McCabe 1999: 527). </p>
    <p>
        Hence, the woodcut ominously shows the boys standing in the center flanked by
            images of Cupid. Behind them on the left is an image of Cupid caught in a fowler&#8217;s net
            from Willye&#8217;s story of his father, which evokes the Homeric myth of Ares (the Roman
            Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus) caught in the act of adultery before the gods on Mt. Olympus
            (March is named after Mars; hence Aries or the Ram is its zodiacal sign, centered at the
            top of the woodcut). On the right is the image from Thomalin&#8217;s story of his encounter
            with Cupid. &#8216;Maybe one of the points of the woodcut is that harmony is the opposite of
            what Protestants expected from the union of Elizabeth and Alen&#231;on&#8217; (Brooks-Davies
            1995: 55). </p>
    <p>
        Of all the eclogues, <hi rend="italics">March</hi> best displays Spenser&#8217;s skill at lading a
        simple and ancient classical myth with wide and fresh import for England. </p>

        poet&#8217;s metaphors for the reader, providing an early cue for modern interpretations
        (sometimes of E.K. himself). Whereas Cupid is certainly &#8216;a supernatural ancient source&#8217;
        (Spitzer 1950: 500), the god is also &#8216;an even more ancient psychological force subsequently
        externalized and apotheosized by classical tradition&#8217; (Berger 1988: 362). </note>

    <p>
        <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> is the second of six Colin Clout eclogues (with
                <hi rend="italics">Jan</hi>, <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Aug</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Nov</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Dec</hi>), and features a
            narrative about the role of the shepherd-poet in his rural community. Whereas <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> has presented Colin&#8217;s private, amorous courtship of
            Rosalind, <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> presents his professional, political courtship
            of Queen Elisa, identified in the Argument as a representation of Queen Elizabeth
            (Montrose 1979: 39). The relationship between poet and monarch comes front
        and center, emphasizing their reciprocity in the <hi rend="italics">making</hi> of each
        other: poetry shapes monarchy; and monarchy shapes poetry (Montrose 1986). </p>
    <p>
        Spenser represents this relationship through a complex three-part structure. In
            lines 1-36, two shepherds who have appeared previously, Thenot and Hobbinol, engage in a
            dialogue about Colin: whereas Hobbinol weeps that his friend has turned away
        from him to Rosalind and now has abandoned his art, Thenot cheerfully asks to hear one of
        Colin&#8217;s songs. In lines 37-153, Hobbinol then &#8216;recorde[s]&#8217; (Arg and line 30) Colin&#8217;s &#8216;laye /
        Of fayre <hi rend="italics">Elisa</hi>, Queene of shepheardes all&#8217; (33-4). Finally, in lines
        154-61 Thenot and Hobbinol agree that Colin has been foolish to sacrifice his art to
        unrequited love. </p>
    <p>
        To offset the inset-lay from the dialogue, Spenser modulates prosody intricately.
            The dialogue proceeds through a four-line stanza (or quatrain) of often rough-sounding
            alliterative verse (the opening line reads, &#8216;what garres thee greete?&#8217;) in a generally
            iambic pentameter line, rhyming <hi rend="italics">abab</hi>. In contrast, Colin&#8217;s lay
            proceeds through an elaborately devised thirteen-stanza unit with each stanza having
            nine lines, rhyming <hi rend="italics">ababccddc</hi>, alternating long and short
            lines: the first, third, fifth, and sixth are generally in iambic
        pentameter; the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth, generally in iambic dimeter; and the
        ninth, generally in iambic tetrameter. It is a remarkable premonition of the nine-line
        stanza of <hi rend="italics">The</hi>
        <hi rend="italics">Faerie Queene</hi> (known as &#8216;the Spenserian stanza&#8217;), and is original to
        English literature. The effect of the eclogue&#8217;s full metrical design is to draw attention to
        the superiority of the poet&#8212;both Colin and Spenser--in the presence of his peers (and
        sovereign). </p>
    <p>
        Clearly, then, the showpiece of the eclogue is Colin&#8217;s lay of Elisa. The lay had
            a substantial contemporary reception, discussed, e.g., by Abraham Fraunce in his 1588
                <hi rend="italics">The Lawiers Logike</hi> (sig. Jiii^r^-Jiiij^v^) and anthologized
            in the 1600 <hi rend="italics">England&#8217;s Helicon</hi> (sig. Cb). In the 1586 <hi rend="italics">Discourse of English Poetrie</hi>, William Webbe discusses the lay
            and curiously turns it into Sapphics (sig. Jii^r^-Jiiij^r^), while in his Lay to Beta,
            on Elizabeth (Eclogue 3), Samuel Daniel offers a clear imitation. Milton, too, was
            attracted to <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi>, as revealed by both <hi rend="italics">Lycidas</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Arcades</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi>
            7: 280). Indeed, Colin&#8217;s lay qualifies as &#8216;one of the chief beauties of the
            <hi rend="italics">Shepheards Calender</hi>, and of Elizabethan verse at large&#8217;
        (Herford, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 275). Further, the &#8216;blazon of Elisa in the &#8220;April&#8221;
        eclogue has become one of the most famous of all the poetic images of the Virgin Queen. But
        retrospect has made it hard to remember that the cult of Elizabeth as maiden goddess was
        still a relatively new phenomenon&#8217; (Norbrook 2002: 74). In particular, Colin&#8217;s lay joins his
            <hi rend="italics">August</hi> sestina on Rosalind and his elegy on Dido in <hi rend="italics">November</hi> in &#8216;stand[ing] out as staking an English claim in the
        poetry of the European Renaissance&#8217; (Alpers 1996: 182). </p>
    <p>
        Colin&#8217;s lay is the first version of what will recur famously throughout the
            Spenser canon: a detailed masculine representation of the female body (cf.
        Micros 1993), indebted to European traditions of the blazon, which here traces to the Song
        of Solomon and to Petrarch&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Rime Sparse</hi> (e.g., 90, 157, 200). Yet
        Spenser&#8217;s specific precedents for celebrating a monarch come from classical pastoral,
        Scripture, and continental pastoral: the praise of a ruler in Theocritus, <hi rend="italics">Idylls</hi> 17, the &#8216;Encomium to Ptolemy&#8217;; the celebration of the princely Roman babe
        as the herald of the return of the Golden Age in Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 4
        (the so-called &#8216;Messianic eclogue&#8217;, because Christians interpreted the babe as Jesus); the
        lovely description of the beloved&#8217;s female body in the Song of Solomon; and the lament for
        the death of a beloved sovereign in Marot&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Complainct de Madame
            Loyse</hi>. In the background as well may be Richard Mulcaster&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">The passage of our most drad Soueraigne Lady Quene Elyzabeth, through the citie of London</hi> (1558 = 1559), which &#8216;describes Elizabeth&#8217;s passage past a succession of elaborate symbolic pageants&#8217; that emphasize &#8216;the mutuality of the love displayed by Elizabeth and her people&#8217;: &#8216;Mulcaster&#8217;s pamphlet has much in common with Virgil&#8217;s fourth eclogue, joyously heralding a reign which promises to bring peace and prosperity to the nation&#8217; (Pugh 2016: 117, 122; see 116-24). As the scriptural precursor text hints, Colin&#8217;s lay, while formally a praise
        poem, is indebted to the tradition of the wedding hymn or ode, known as the epithalamium.
        Yet the eclogue&#8217;s double structure of dialogue-and-song suggests a compound depiction of the
        poet in relation with the monarch. On the one hand, <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> tells a
        triumphal story about Colin&#8217;s use of his art to praise his sovereign, depicting an idealized
        poet-monarch relation, which presumably becomes useful to Spenser in advertising his address
        to the queen and important to the leadership he offers to other poets. On the other hand,
            <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> tells a disastrous story about the poet&#8217;s unrequited love
        for Rosalind as impeding this very model, thereby tempering the idealization through lament. </p>
    <p>
        Is <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi>, then, a praise poem (Cain 1978:
        14-24), or a poem of &#8216;resistance&#8217; relying on &#8216;the &#8220;doubleness&#8221;&#8217; of &#8216;camouflage&#8217; (Norbrook
        2002: 78-80)? For that matter, is the subject of the eclogue Elizabeth as &#8216;queen of England
        and head of the English church&#8217;, with &#8216;the panegyric ode . . . the closest <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes Calender</hi> comes to expressing a complete and idyllic
        unity of nation and church&#8217; (Halpern 1991: 205); or does <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi>
        present the political leader as &#8216;a personification of pastoral poetry&#8217;, with Spenser
        emphasizing &#8216;Elizabeth&#8217;s status as an ideal image created by the poet&#8217; (Montrose 1979:
        40-1)? </p>
    <p>
        Although the eclogue is rich enough to sustain affirmative answers to all of
            these questions, the woodcut emphasizes the latter interpretation. It presents the queen
            standing in the center, surrounded by ten dancing ladies holding musical instruments,
            suggesting the classical Muses, while Colin stands off to the left, facing the dance and
            playing his pipe, his smaller scale suggesting that he conjures up the vision with his
            art. Above Colin, in the background, are Thenot and Hobbinol, with their sheep in front
            of them and the house to which they return at the end behind them (160). Yet even
            further in the background, toward the middle and on a hill, stands an imperial city,
            reminding viewers that &#8216;&#8220;Aprill&#8221; serves to predict the heroic poem that was already
            being composed&#8217; (Oram 1989: 69). At the top, and centered, is the zodiacal
        sign of Taurus, the Bull, a reference to the myth of Jupiter disguising himself as a bull to
        carry off the beautiful girl Europa, which Ovid uses to tell how &#8216;&#8220;majesty and love&#8221; do not
        go well together&#8217;, a warning to Elizabeth about the dangers of marrying the French Duc
        d&#8217;Alen&#231;on (McCabe 1999: 530, quoting <hi rend="italics">Met</hi> 2.846-7; see Brooks-Davies
        1995: 64). </p>
    <p>
        For its complex artistic design, its bifurcated representation of a relationship at the
        heart of sixteenth-century literature, and its importance within a long reception history,
            <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> commands attention as a set piece of <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> and of English poetry. </p>

        sense that it evokes the powerful ethos of political and social alienation, evoked by
        Virgil&#8217;s first eclogue, and topical in that it also evokes the prevalent mood of
        contemporary England&#8217;, characterized by fear that Queen Elizabeth would marry Alen&#231;on
        (McCabe 1995: 21). Indeed, &#8216;alienation is the defining characteristic of Colin Clout&#8217; and
        &#8216;the central strategy of Spenser&#8217;s poetry, which forces his readers to reencounter their
        native tongue through a process of occlusion and defamiliarization&#8217;: &#8216;A disinclination to

        preferred locale, a symbol of the harmony of poetic inspiration. Spenser takes over the
        trope from predecessors (e.g., Theocritus, <hi rend="italics">Idylls</hi> 1.7-8; Marot, <hi rend="italics">Complainct</hi>
        <hi rend="italics">de Madame Loyse</hi> 2.261), yet he makes it his own by inflecting it in
        specific ways (<hi rend="italics">June</hi> 8, <hi rend="italics">Aug</hi> 155, <hi rend="italics">Dec</hi> 1, and woodcuts to <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi>, <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Dec</hi>, as well as <hi rend="italics">Petrarch</hi> 4). Subsequent poets imitate the trope widely: Drayton, <hi rend="italics">Pastorals</hi>, Eclogue 3.63-4: &#8216;And let them set together all, / Time
        keeping with the Waters fall&#8217;; and <hi rend="italics">The Return from Pernassus</hi> (1606),
        sig. B^v^, where the anonymous authors identify the waterfall as Spenser&#8217;s &#8216;signature&#8217;
        (Hollander 1988: 176): &#8216;to the waters fall he tun&#8217;d for fame, / And in each barke engrav&#8217;d
        Elizaes name.&#8217; The poet&#8217;s special relationship with the land, here and throughout the lay,
        evokes the myth of Orpheus as a civilizing poet, able to move the woods, stop the flow of
        rivers, and tame wild beasts, for Colin &#8216;charms the external world into configuration around
        Eliza&#8217; (Cain 1978: 10-4). See also <hi rend="italics">Letters</hi> 4.6-7n. In the first
        recorded commentary on Spenser&#8217;s waterfall trope, William Webbe sees an equation with
        Colin&#8217;s verse-form, which includes &#8216;manie unequall verses, but most sweetelie falling
        together, which the Poet calleth the tune of the waters fall&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi>

        thirteen-stanza lay has an elaborate structure, dividing into two six-stanza sequences, with
        the seventh stanza serving as a bridge (Cain 1978: 20-2). Two patterns emerge: in the first,
        the two sequences mirror each other in content (e.g., stanza 1 mirrors stanza 8); in the
        second, the sequences are symmetrical (e.g., stanza 1 matches stanza 13). Whereas the first
        sequence presents a static icon, featuring a stationary Eliza, the second is dynamic,
        evoking a masquelike progression. If in the first sequence Colin functions as the poetic <hi rend="italics">maker</hi> of an artistic image, in the second he functions as a <hi rend="italics">vates</hi> or visionary; these are the two principal roles of the poet
        coming out of antiquity and familiar from Renaissance treatises on poetry. The specific
        content of the elaborate structure derives from and adapts the rhetorical tradition of
        encomiastic poetry, designed to immortalize an important person, especially rulers (Cain
        1978: 6-7, 14-15); the structure includes the following parts: <hi rend="italics">proemium

        <mentioned><hi rend="italics">your silver song</hi></mentioned>: E.K. mis-attributes the
        phrase to Hesiod (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 288). The phrase &#8216;silver song&#8217; might seem
        paradoxical, attaching a color or material substance to a sound. Yet the word &#8216;silver&#8217; could
        mean &#8216;Of sounds: Having a clear gentle resonance like that of silver; soft-toned, melodious&#8217;
            (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi>). The word &#8216;silver&#8217; also has connotations of whiteness,
        brightness, clearness, and riches (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi>), making it a metaphor for
        purity, illumination, lucidity, and value. One other association may bear on Spenser&#8217;s
        interest: the word&#8217;s use in ornamentation (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi>), evoking his
        pioneering role in developing a sixteenth-century eloquent style. Since Spenser so often
        uses &#8216;silver&#8217; as an adjective for &#8216;song&#8217;, &#8216;sound&#8217;, and &#8216;swan&#8217; within an alliterative phrase,
        and since E.K. records its origin in a classical author, it qualifies as a metonym for an
        eloquent intertextual authorship, and thus for Spenserian poetry itself. Hence its
        appearance opening both <hi rend="italics">Time</hi> (&#8216;silver streaming <hi rend="italics">Thamesis</hi>&#8217; [2]) and <hi rend="italics">Proth</hi> (&#8216;silver streaming <hi rend="italics">Themmes</hi>&#8217; [11]): the fountain of Spenser&#8217;s eloquent, intertextual art
        of mutability. Spenser&#8217;s language in <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> equates the silver song
        with Elisa, at once tracing the origin of Colin&#8217;s art to the queen and identifying Elisa as
        the form that his art takes. On the allied phrase &#8216;silver sound&#8217; in the Spenser canon, see
        notes at <hi rend="italics">June</hi> 61, <hi rend="italics">Aug</hi> 181, as well as <hi rend="italics">Oct</hi> [90] for E.K.&#8217;s quotation of two lost lines of Spenserian verse,

        see Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Met</hi> 1.689-712. In assigning the name Pan to Henry VIII,
        Spenser transposes Marot, <hi rend="italics">Complainct de Madame Loyse</hi>, who applies
        the name to Fran&#231;ois I. But Spenser&#8217;s extrapolation of the Ovidian myth to represent
        Elizabeth&#8217;s parents is bold, since Ovid tells how the god attempts to rape the river nymph.
        Given that this attempted rape leads to the invention of the syrinx, or panpipe (the musical
        instrument of pastoral), Spenser uses the myth to record the origin of his own art&#8212;and
        perhaps even of the Henrician era (the age of Skelton and Barclay, Wyatt and Surrey, poets
        important in differing ways to <hi rend="italics">SC</hi>). Colin refers to the myth again

        pastoral poetry in the Tenth Prose of his <hi rend="italics">Arcadia</hi>&#8217;, when the
        shepherds see the Pipe of Pan hung on a cave, and a priest narrates Ovid&#8217;s story of Pan and
        Syrinx with allusions to both Theocritus and Virgil, including the Messianic Eclogue (one of

    <p>
        <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> is the first of three ecclesiastical eclogues, followed by <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi> and <hi rend="italics">September</hi>; but it has affinities
        with the &#8216;moral&#8217; dialogue-and-fable structure of <hi rend="italics">Februarye</hi>, the
        family narrative of <hi rend="italics">March</hi>, and the holiday-dance atmosphere of <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi>. These four topics--politics, courtly ethics, family life,
        artistic holiday&#8212;open up the resonance of <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> considerably. </p>
    <p>
        Without question, the eclogue focuses on church politics, as indicated by E.K. in
            his Argument and his glosses but also by the dialogue between two middle-age shepherds,
            Piers and Palinode, who use key ecclesiastical language to evoke contemporary religious
            debates. Their dialogue divides into three parts. In lines 1-173, the shepherds advance
            cases for radically different pastoral &#8216;perspectives&#8217; on &#8216;the role of the priest in the
            world&#8217; (Cullen 1970: 41): Palinode, for the care-free pleasure of May Day
        festivals as acceptable acts of conduct; Piers, for austere pastoral discipline prohibiting
        such conduct. Then, in lines 174-305 Piers tells an Aesopian fable about the Fox and the
        Kid, featuring the Kid&#8217;s vulnerability to the wiles of the Fox, despite the care of the
        Kid&#8217;s mother. Finally, in lines 306-17 the two shepherds amicably discuss the social utility
        of the fable and go home for the night. </p>
    <p>
        The shepherds&#8217; dialogue replays debates familiar from such Henrician, Edwardian,
            and Marian polemicists as William Turner and John Bale, and in particular the
            Elizabethan Anthony Gilby&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Pleasant Dialogue</hi> (composed 1566,
            published late 1570s), between a zealous Protestant and a worldly chaplain (Norbrook
            2002: 57; see Hume 1984: 20-5; J.N. King 1990: 37). In the background, as
        well, lies <hi rend="italics">A Theatre for Voluptuous Worldlings</hi>, which presents Jan
        van der Noot&#8217;s commentary on the history of the slow collapse of the Church, drawing heavily
        on Bale&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Image of Both Churches</hi>. The work of situating the present
        in a history of the Church, a history carefully articulated to bring it in accord&#8212;or into
        various accords&#8212;with the prophetic idioms of the biblical books of Daniel and Revelation is
        not only Bale&#8217;s project but also the historical vision of John Foxe&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Acts and Monuments</hi>. Piers&#8217; fable adapts Aesop&#8217;s story of the Wolf and Kid, turning
        the Wolf of Catholic evil into a deceptive Fox, in accord with Protestant polemic against
        Church of England clergy (Brennan 1986). Moreover, in the background is Psalm 23, &#8216;The Lord
        is my shepherd,&#8217; and John 10:14, Christ as the Good Shepherd, but also the tradition of
        ecclesiastical satire emerging in the eclogues of Petrarch, Boccaccio, and Mantuan.
        Combining continental, biblical, classical, and historical materials, <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> thus offers a rich meditation on the role of the Elizabethan pastor in
        matters of church government, focusing primarily on the behavior of the episcopate, the
        acceptability of their wearing vestments, and the threat of the Jesuit Mission infiltrating
        England (undercover priests meeting secretly with the Catholic faithful). The dialogue
        format ensures that Spenser&#8217;s own perspective remains concealed. Milton famously indicted
        Palinode as &#8216;that false Shepheard&#8217; who figures &#8216;our Prelates, whose life is a recantation of
        their pastorall vow&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Animadversions upon the Remonstrants Defence
            against Smectymnuus</hi>, in <hi rend="italics">Prose Works</hi> 1953: 1.722), but
        Palinode does appear as a sympathetic, even affable figure (Cain 1988: 86; Chamberlain 2005:
        49). </p>
    <p>
        <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> also has a social dynamic that focuses on the
            importance of &#8216;care&#8217;, a word that appears five times (48, 77, 96, 180, 215), more than
            in any other eclogue. Not merely pastors but parents and the sovereign herself are
            pressed to engage in a social duty committed to self-sacrifice, modeled on the teachings
            of &#8216;Algrind&#8217; (a figure for Edmund Grindal, Archbishop of Canterbury [see 75n; cf. Lane
            1993: 101,109]). The concept of care is tied to work, and indicates
        Spenser&#8217;s interest in signaling a shift from a classical ideal of pastoral otium (leisure)
        to a medieval ideal of agrarian labor: in short, from Virgil&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> to Langland&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Piers Plowman</hi> (Little 2013:
        143-56). </p>
    <p>
        When Piers criticizes shepherds that &#8216;caren little&#8217; for their &#8216;flocke&#8217; (39-49),
            he uses a pastoral metaphor that Spenser first applies to himself in his role as poet
            (&#8216;To His Booke&#8217; 9-10). Hence, <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> includes details that extend
            the dialogue to the role of art and poetry in the world (Montrose 1983:
        451-2; Alpers 1985: 94)--in particular, to the difficulty that those who lack art (and by
        extension, poetry) have when trying to care for their flock (Berger 1988: 304; see
        Chamberlain 2005: 45; L.S. Johnson 1990: 77-9; Herman 1992: 19-20). Such artistic details
        emerge first in the Argument, when E.K. says that Piers and Palinode &#8216;<hi rend="italics">represent</hi> . . . two <hi rend="italics">formes</hi> of pastours or Ministers&#8217;, with
        Piers pausing to &#8216;<hi rend="italics">tell . . . a tale</hi>&#8217; to Palinode (2-7; emphasis
        added). Palinode&#8217;s depiction of May Day &#8216;mask[ing]&#8217;, with its &#8216;merimake&#8217; (2, 15) of
        &#8216;shepheardes . . . singing&#8217;, &#8216;play[ing]&#8217;, &#8216;pyp[ing]&#8217;, and &#8216;daunc[ing]&#8217; to &#8216;fetchen home May
        with their musicall&#8217; (20-8), formally versifies poetic art. At one point, Spenser&#8217;s
        willingness to implicate himself as a poet appears especially daring, for the deceptive Fox
        has a &#8216;hinder heele . . . wrapt in a clout&#8217; (243)&#8212;the word &#8216;clout&#8217; nominally meaning bandage
        but inescapably evoking Colin Clout, as Spenser&#8217;s pun in <hi rend="italics">November</hi>
        makes available. There, Queen Elisa gives her shepherds &#8216;clouted Creame. / O heavie herse, /
        Als Colin cloute she would not once disdayne&#8217; (99-101; see note, and <hi rend="italics">March</hi> 50n). The artistic details are so pervasive that we may well see the eclogue
        as &#8216;an allegory about allegory, or about the imperative for allegorical reading&#8217; (Halpern
        1991: 210 on the fable; see 182, 208-11). Intriguingly, Spenser presents the instrumentality
        of poetic narrative itself when, at the end, Palinode ask Piers, &#8216;let me thy tale borrowe&#8217;
        (308), the word &#8216;borrowe&#8217; evoking the process of imitation, of putting art to work in
        society. In <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi>, that work is the mark of valuable &#8216;pastours&#8217;:
        clergy, politicians, heads of family, authors. </p>
    <p>
        Remarkably, the woodcut features an artistic reading, exiling the debating
            shepherds to the upper-left corner, breaking the fable into three parts scattered around
            the block, and bringing Palinode&#8217;s May Day festival front and center: eight
        figures (and one standing figure) dance around a wagon carrying a man and a woman (&#8216;the Lord
        of Misrule and his lady&#8217; [Luborksy 1981: 35]), pulled by two winged horses, evoking Pegasus,
        symbol of poetic inspiration and artistic fame (Cain in Oram 1989: 86), perhaps with the
        symbolic power of Plato&#8217;s winged horses of reason and desire in the <hi rend="italics">Phaedrus</hi> 
        (cf. Borris 2017: 83-121; see <hi rend="italics">Dec</hi> 63-4n). </p>
    <p>
        The verse of <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> consists of a varying meter of a
            tetrameter line in couplets, divided between Piers&#8217; &#8216;rugged tetrameters&#8217; that evoke &#8216;the
            moral ethos of [work in] <hi rend="italics">The Plowman&#8217;s Tale</hi>&#8217; and Palinode&#8217;s
            &#8216;infectious music&#8217; evoking May Day sport (McCabe 1999: 534), as well as
        contrasting two models of time, one largely artistic, the other finally religious:
        Palinode&#8217;s classical &#8216;<hi rend="italics">carpe diem</hi> attitude&#8217; and Piers&#8217; Christian
        attitude toward history leading to the &#8216;account&#8217; (51, 54) of the Last Judgment (Snyder 1998:
        34). </p>
    <p>
        Easily the longest of the eclogues at 321 lines, <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> assumes a
        central position in <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes Calender</hi>&#8212;indeed in the Spenser
        canon&#8212;for representing a compelling interplay of church, state, and family in the realm of
        English poetry. </p>

        319-39; Norbrook 2002: 56); however, Spenser&#8217;s Piers is not a plowman, or figure of rural

        generally): a recantation, retraction, or withdrawal of a statement&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi>). Spenser&#8217;s shepherd is a &#8216;palinode&#8217; in that his &#8216;seize the day&#8217; poetics,

        John&#8217; at <hi rend="italics">TVW</hi> 15.1, this is the first use of the word &#8216;saint&#8217; in
        Spenser&#8217;s poetic canon. He uses the word sparingly, although in <hi rend="italics">FQ</hi> I
        he features &#8216;<hi rend="italics">Saint George</hi>&#8217; as a Protestant hero (x.61), while in his
        marriage poetry he recurrently identifies Elizabeth Boyle as his &#8216;sweete Saint&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Am</hi> 22.4; see, e.g., <hi rend="italics">Epith</hi> 208). In the
        context of Palinode&#8217;s speech and character, the reference evokes Catholicism&#8217;s veneration of
        sainthood and saints days, allowed by conservative members of the English Church, even
        though oppositional to the Calvinist concept of &#8216;the elect&#8217; (Brooks-Davies 1995: 82; see
        J.N. King 1990: 40, 188-99). At 247, Palinode refers to &#8216;sweete Saint Charitee&#8217;, and in his
        gloss E.K. notes the Catholicism. Cf. <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi> 113-26, where Thomalin
        assigns the Reformation model to Algrind, whose teaching distinguishes between the outward
        celebration of a mountain, because it is sacred to a saint, and the inward celebration of
        the saint himself, because he has been elected to heaven. </note>

        represent &#8216;a secret papist who presents himself as a Church of England pastor&#8217;, as told by a
        Puritan Piers (Hume 1984: 23) or Catholicism, since the &#8216;hostility to &#8220;popery&#8221; was not a

    <p>
        <hi rend="italics">June</hi> is the central eclogue of <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes Calender</hi>. As the first eclogue in
            which Colin Clout appears in dialogue with another shepherd (Hobbinol), it rehearses the
            topic that organizes the work: the poet&#8217;s career and his role in society.
        The 120 lines (the same number as <hi rend="italics">October</hi>, the other eclogue on the poet&#8217;s career) evoke the
        &#8216;maximum human life span between the Fall and the Flood&#8217; (Brooks-Davies 1995: 102, citing
        Gen 6:3), bringing the &#8216;course&#8217; of Colin&#8217;s career (33)&#8212;and specifically &#8216;the half-way topos
        of classical pastoral&#8217; (Bernard 1981: 316)--front and center.
        </p>
    <p>
        The dialogue itself is unusually complex, and its trajectory difficult to follow,
            filled not merely with &#8216;inconsistencies&#8217; that baffle narrative expectations (cf. Hoffman
            1977: 61-9; Berger 1988: 435-7) but with segments disjointed by apparently
        failed rhetorical transition. Nonetheless, the dialogue can be divided into three main
        parts. First, in lines 1-64 Hobbinol tempts the dejected Colin, who suffers from unrequited
        love over Rosalind, to abandon his high aspiration for the &#8216;hilles&#8217; and &#8216;to the dales
        resort&#8217; (19-21), while Colin rejects such a return to &#8216;carelesse yeeres&#8217; because he has
        reached &#8216;ryper age&#8217; (33-6), and Hobbinol persists, praising Colin&#8217;s youthful art for its
        Orphic potency to attract the dazed attention of &#8216;Calliope&#8217;, Muse of epic (57-64). Second,
        in lines 65-112 Colin refuses to &#8216;presume to Parnasse hyll&#8217;, preferring to &#8216;pype lowe in
        shade of lowly grove&#8217; (70-1): he rejects &#8216;flying fame&#8217; (75), praises &#8216;Tityrus&#8217; for using his
        art to &#8216;slake / The flames&#8217; of &#8216;love&#8217; in his community of shepherds (85-6), and vaunts that,
        if he himself possessed Tityrus&#8217; Orphic power to &#8216;teache the trees&#8217; to cry (96), he would
        target Rosalind, who has betrayed his faith by taking up with the shepherd Menalcus.
        Finally, in lines 113-20 Hobbinol records that Colin&#8217;s art has affected <hi rend="italics">him</hi>, and invites the
        disconsolate Colin &#8216;home&#8217; to avoid the &#8216;stealing steppes&#8217; of &#8216;night&#8217; (119).
         </p>
    <p>
        <hi rend="italics">June</hi> features clear echoes of two Virgilian source-texts: <hi rend="italics">Eclogue</hi> 1,
        which presents the dialogue between Tityrus, the poet figure who sits serenely in his
        pastoral landscape, and Meliboeus, the disaffected shepherd who has had his land
        dispossessed by the Roman authorities; and the <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi>, which presents the hero Aeneas, lover
        of Queen Dido, as an exile wandering toward his epic destiny (cf. Lindheim 2005: 34). Yet in
        making Colin a hybrid figure of both Virgilian pastoral and epic, Spenser makes three
        adjustments to his precursor. First, he reverses the pastoral role that Virgil had assigned
        to his own poet-figure, the serene Tityrus, giving that role to Hobbinol, and making Colin
        the exiled Meliboeus, a poet of disaffection (cf. Bernard 1989: 57). Second, Spenser changes
        the rationale for the disaffection: not the politics of Roman land-displacement but the
        trauma of unrequited love. And third, Spenser evokes an epic role for a shepherd-poet who
        precisely abandons his epic destiny because of unrequited love. In particular, when Colin
        imagines his poetry vengefully to &#8216;pierce&#8217; Rosalind&#8217;s &#8216;heart&#8217; (100), Spenser may glance at
        Petrarch&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Rime Sparse</hi> 239 (one of Petrarch&#8217;s sestinas on poetry), where the poet imagines
        <hi rend="italics">facendo a lei ragion ch&#8217; a me fa forza</hi> (9 &#8216;bringing her [Laura] to account who overpowers
        me&#8217;): <hi rend="italics">&#8217;n quante note / &#242; riprovato umiliar quell&#8217;alma!&#8217;</hi> (14-15 &#8216;in how many notes / have I
        attempted to humble that soul!&#8217;).
         </p>
    <p>
        How do we interpret the poet-persona&#8217;s Petrarchan rejection of the literary forms
            making up the Virgilian progression that the <hi rend="italics">Calender</hi> itself advertises for its author?
            The question is complicated, because &#8216;Spenser&#8217;s lines and phrases&#8217;&#8212;which tend toward
            positive evocations of an important national literary project&#8212;&#8216;detach themselves from
            their sentences&#8217; (Alpers 1985: 89), and this detachment helps advance the
        doubleness that has characterized <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> (see headnote).
       </p>
    <p>
        The difficulties of <hi rend="italics">June</hi> thus raise important questions. First, does Colin
            &#8216;forsake the pastoral Paradise for a dedicated life&#8217; (Hamilton 1968: 37), or
        does Colin &#8216;do . . . no such thing&#8217; but instead simply reject Rosalind (Durr 1957: 284)?
        Second, does the eclogue rehearse a debate about the poet but refuse to resolve the issue
        (cf. Cullen 1970: 83-90; Hoffman 1977: 61), or does it critique certain features of
        Elizabethan society: its courtly poetry, with its commitment to delight, valuing instead the
        native tradition of Chaucer and Skelton, with their plain poetry of social complaint (Lane
        1995: 152-8); or perhaps society&#8217;s misguided commitment to a &#8216;paradise principle&#8217;, in which
        Hobbinol&#8217;s na&#239;ve longing for paradise is as limiting as Colin&#8217;s putatively mature rejection
        of such escapism (Berger 1988: 432-41)? How, finally, are we to read Colin&#8217;s refusal to take
        Hobbinol&#8217;s advice: does Spenser use the &#8216;topos of inability or affected modesty&#8217; as &#8216;an
        indirect tactic of self-assertion&#8217; to &#8216;predict . . . Colin&#8217;s transformation into a poet of
        epic&#8217; (Cain in Oram 1989: 107-8); or does Spenser feature the poet&#8217;s growing alienation from
        the society that the epic poet is meant to serve (cf. McCabe 1995: 21, 1999: 540; Nicholson
        2008; Pugh 2016: 103, 105, 112, 181)?
         </p>
    <p>
        One possibility is that <hi rend="italics">June</hi> is central because it features a new Petrarchan
            space for the author&#8217;s Virgilian career. If looked at closely, the eclogue&#8217;s strange
            narrative disjunctions air a new idea for the English poet, one that is original to
            Spenser: that the Petrarchan erotic complaint can form a bridge between low
        pastoral and high epic (cf. P. Cheney 1993: 92-8). The role of love in the eclogue is indeed
        central. In the eclogue&#8217;s first part, Colin fails to sing songs because of Rosalind, and he
        refuses Hobbinol&#8217;s advice to abandon the epic hills for the pastoral dales, preferring a
        third space that forms a place apart. In this space (33-48, 65-80), Colin both turns away
        from lowly pastoral &#8216;pleasure&#8217; (36) and rejects the epic presumption of &#8216;Parnasse hyll&#8217;
        (70), choosing instead to &#8216;pyp[e] . . . lowe in shade of lowly grove&#8217;: &#8216;I play to please my
        selfe&#8217; (71-2). Spenser deftly exchanges the communal Virgilian shade of the pastoral beech
        tree from Eclogue 1 for the consummate place of Petrarchan solitude and inward musing in the
        <hi rend="italics">Rime Sparse</hi> (e.g., Song 129.1-3, 14-29). Accordingly, in the eclogue&#8217;s second part Colin
        celebrates Tityrus&#8217; success in using erotic song to slake desire: Tityrus alone solves the
        Petrarchan problem. Yet the doubleness of the representation&#8212;Colin&#8217;s private failure as a
        love poet; Tityrus&#8217; public success--pinpoints a structural key to SC: Colin fails to use
        love poetry to carry out his career as a Virgilian author of pastoral preparing for epic;
        but Spenser himself succeeds Chaucer in his self-defining role as a national love poet. In
        <hi rend="italics">October</hi>, Spenser will return to this three-genre model of the English courtly poet (see
        headnote).
         </p>
    <p>
        The woodcut draws attention to the centrality of the poet&#8217;s role in society, but does not
        make clear which figure is Colin and which Hobbinol. On the right, a figure appears shrouded
        in the pleasure of the <hi rend="italics">locus amoenus</hi>, standing contentedly under a shade tree, beside a
        stream, with sheep resting peacefully and with birds flying overhead; at his feet lies a
        broken pipe. This last detail seems to identify the figure as Colin; however, the figure&#8217;s
        position in the pleasure garden corresponds to the role of Hobbinol in the eclogue proper.
        In the center, a second figure gestures beyond the harvesters of summer working amid their
        haycocks to a steep hill with a city topping it. The topos of dale and hill corresponds to a
        lower pastoral leisure (with a gesture to georgic labor) and a higher epic duty to the
        nation . In the eclogue, Hobbinol does this gesturing, but he directs Colin to turn from
        hill back to dale. The woodcut thus offers a counterpoint to the eclogue.
         </p>
    <p>
        Finally, as if to accentuate the centrality of <hi rend="italics">June</hi>,
            Spenser invents an eight-line stanza rhyming <hi rend="italics">ababbaba</hi>. The
            second set of four lines reverses the order of the first four, creating two quatrains
            that mirror each other, with a heavy emphasis at the midpoint on the &#8216;b&#8217; rhyme&#8212;an
            intriguing anticipation of the nine-line stanza of <hi rend="italics">FQ</hi> (<hi rend="italics">ababbcbcc</hi>). The success of such a &#8216;difficult&#8217; rhyme may be
            debatable (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 308, 310), but long ago Thomas
        Warton called <hi rend="italics">June</hi> &#8216;one of the most poetical and elegant of the
        Pastorals&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 308). Indeed, its virtuoso effect competes with
        one of the high-water marks of <hi rend="italics">SC</hi>, Colin&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">August</hi> sestina (Brooks-Davies 1995: 102). Through heightened verse accomplishment,
            <hi rend="italics">June</hi> accrues significance, not because it clarifies a new idea
        of an English literary career, but because it troubles it. </p>

        of poetry--e.g., Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Ecl</hi> 1.51-8 (Pugh 2016: 94-5): &#8216;<hi rend="italics">nature</hi> is really a synonym for <hi rend="italics">art</hi>&#8217; (Berger 1988: 325; see 408). Hence, the wind is &#8216;warbling&#8217;, and the birds, a
        traditional symbol of the poet, temper their &#8216;tunes&#8217; to the waterfall, just as Colin does at
            <hi rend="italics">Apr</hi> 35-6 (see note). The word &#8216;dight&#8217;, a favorite of Spenser&#8217;s,
        can mean &#8216;adorn&#8217; but also &#8216;compose&#8217; (see <hi rend="italics">Apr</hi> 29), while &#8216;attemper&#8217;
        means &#8216;To attune, bring into harmony&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi>). &#8216;Delyte&#8217; is a key word
        in English Renaissance literary criticism for one of the Horatian goals of poetry; it recurs
        at 29, 35, 40, 51 (see &#8216;pleasures&#8217; at 32, 36). Even the &#8216;Bramble bush&#8217; is Colin&#8217;s tree (the

        (e.g., &#8216;silver song&#8217; at <hi rend="italics">Apr</hi> 46; see note). Evidently, he did not
        invent the phrase &#8216;silver sound&#8217;, for it appears in Richard Edwards&#8217; <hi rend="italics">Song</hi>, printed in <hi rend="italics">The Paradise of dainty Devises</hi> (1576),
        quoted six times in a single dialogue from <hi rend="italics">Romeo and Juliet</hi> for

            <hi rend="italics">Flowers of Epigrammes</hi> (1577). The phrase has a remarkable
        afterlife in English literature (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 318)--from John Lyly and Sir
        John Davies to John Dryden and Alexander Pope--much of it retaining the aesthetic vocabulary
        that Spenser turns into a signature. See, e.g., Davies, <hi rend="italics">Orchestra</hi>,
        st. 107: &#8216;And when your Ivory fingers touch the strings / Of any silver sounding instrument,
        / Love makes them daunce&#8217;. Examples in Richard Barnfield (<hi rend="italics">The prayse of

        refuses to write epic; but see also Horace, <hi rend="italics">Odes</hi> 4.15.1-4; Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Amores</hi> 3.1; Propertius, <hi rend="italics">Elegies</hi> 3.3.1-26;

        <p>With <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi> occupies a
            central position in the structure of the <hi rend="italics">Calender</hi>, and thus the
            two eclogues share the topos of hill and dale: the two speakers of a debate
        between high and low, Morrell and Thomalin, enact the two sides of &#8216;Colin&#8217;s divided mind&#8217;
        (Snyder 1998: 37), &#8216;aspiration versus retirement&#8217; (Berger 1988: 305). </p>
        <p>As
        the second of three ecclesiastical eclogues (with <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> and <hi rend="italics">September</hi>), <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi> specifically stages a
        debate on important matters of church politics. In the woodcut, the goatherd Morrell sits on
        a hill, with his goats scattered along its slopes, while Thomalin stands below, his sheep
        ordered obediently. Since the woodcut depicts Morrell as tonsured, it is natural to take
        E.K.&#8217;s cue in the Argument to identify the shepherd as a &#8216;Catholique . . . Pastour&#8217;, and
        thereby to identify Thomalin as &#8216;protestant&#8217;. In these terms, the dialogue appears as a
        simple Protestant condemnation of Catholic aspiration for worldly ambition in church
        hierarchy, and, correspondingly, a defense of the lowly life of inner Protestant faith. Yet
        E.K. in his Argument is perhaps more accurate when he says that the eclogue honors &#8216;good
        shepeheardes&#8217; and dishonors &#8216;proud and ambitious Pastours&#8217;, which evokes a debate within the
        English church itself and active at Cambridge in the 1570s. </p>
        <p>The shepherds&#8217; dialogue divides into three parts (Cullen 1970: 56).
        In lines 1-56, Thomalin and Morrell debate the merits of low and high; in lines 57-124, they
        delineate particular hills and dales with historical and mythological significance; and in
        lines 125-232 they discuss the fate of the shepherd Algrind, who has been knocked off his
        hill by a female eagle who has accidentally dropped a shellfish on his head. </p>
        <p>The underlying biblical text is Isaiah 40:4: &#8216;Everie valleie shalbe
        exalted, and everie mountaine and hill shalbe made low&#8217;. Yet the key pastoral source-text
        is Mantuan&#8217;s eighth eclogue, which introduces the locale of hill and dale in a debate about
        the value of each. Spenser imitates Mantuan&#8217;s landscape but emphasizes its symbolic
        associations, and he transposes the debate to Reformation England (Renwick, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 325). </p>
        <p>Hence, Spenser adopts a verse-form associated with Protestantism, a divided
            &#8216;fourteener&#8217;: a single line of fourteen beats breaks into a second line
        after the eighth beat, but thus features a longer line followed by a shorter one, which
        George Turbervile had used in his 1567 translation of Mantuan (Cain in Oram 1989: 120). On
        the surface, <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi> may seem &#8216;impossible&#8217; to &#8216;consider felicitous&#8217;
        (Palgrave, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 323)&#8212;&#8216;in a literary sense the less distinguished
        of the Eclogues&#8217; (Herford, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 323)&#8212;yet the jaunty rhythm of the
        alternating lines lends the eclogue a sense of playfulness, one that comes across in another
        way in the shellfish allegory, despite the seriousness of its ecclesiastical politics. </p>
        <p>Indeed, <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi> handles the historical milieu of the debate
            deftly, making it difficult to determine just what Spenser does with &#8216;perspective&#8217;
            (Anderson 1970). Does he &#8216;dramatiz[e] . . . a conflict of pastoral perspectives, neither
            of which is without merit&#8217; (Cullen 1970: 61); or does he rely on &#8216;disguise&#8217;
        as a device of &#8216;self-protection&#8217; (J.N. King 1990: 41-2), thereby aligning himself with a
        particular social, political, and ecclesiastical faction, or perhaps simply to air
        controversial events (Norbrook 2002: 54, 62-3; Hume 1984: 28-33)? </p>
        <p>The most obvious event is the notorious fall of &#8216;Algrind&#8217;, representing
            Archbishop Grindal, who fell from the queen&#8217;s favor in 1577 for refusing to suppress the
            so-called &#8216;prophesyings&#8217;, private gatherings of clergy who interpreted Scripture outside
            the boundaries of prescribed homilies and sermonizing (Hadfield 2012:
        136-8). At stake here, then, is whether Spenser is an &#8216;Anglican&#8217; (Whitaker 1950; Wall 1988),
        a &#8216;Puritan&#8217; (Hume 1984), or simply a &#8216;progressive Protestant&#8217; (J.N. King 2006: 71, 1990:
        233-8; cf. Norbrook 2002: 55). In any case, Spenser displays shrewdness in characterizing
        both Morrell and Thomalin with sympathy and insight, representing a complex meditation on
        the nature of religious identity: &#8216;If Thomalin locates the dark side of aspiration in
        Morrell&#8217;s pride, Morrell in turn points to the negative, withdrawing side of Thomalin&#8217;s
        humility&#8217; (Snyder 1998: 39). </p>
        <p>The ecclesiastical debate also extends to social and political issues of
            hierarchy and class, including questions over labor: between upper-class
        idleness and lower-class work (Lane 1993: 114-31), featured in the background of the
        woodcut, where summertime harvesters contrast with Morrell sitting on his hill and with
        Thomalin standing by. </p>
        <p>Yet <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi> is finally &#8216;central&#8217; because it relates church
            and state to poetry, as intimated by the implied comparison with Colin Clout from <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, as suggested by Morrell&#8217;s reference to the &#8216;Muses&#8217;
            dwelling on Mount Parnassus (45-8), and as documented by the two other classical myths
            emerging in the dialogue, both identified as taking place on Mt Ida (but see note on
            [59]): Endymion and Phoebe (57-64) and Paris and Helen (145-52; see Stewart
        1988). In fact, the eclogue presents here not merely a model of the familiar Renaissance
        humanist project of relating classical to biblical, but a sophisticated fiction about the
        merits and dangers of doing so: Thomalin &#8216;objects to the indiscriminate conflation of
        biblical and classical imagery which informs Morrell&#8217;s argument. For him, Mount Olivet
        [sacred to Christ and his teaching] and Mount Ida are distinct. . . . As in <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi>, the two speakers inhabit conflicting imaginative, as well as
        moral, worlds. Accordingly, they read the pastoral landscape differently. From Thomalin&#8217;s
        viewpoint, Morrell appropriates the spiritual significance of mountains in support of social
        climbing. From Morrell&#8217;s viewpoint, Thomalin distorts the traditional symbolism of valleys
        in order to denigrate legitimate social eminence&#8217; (McCabe 1999: 544). </p>
        <p>Spenser&#8217;s evocation of his own poetic art during a debate having more overt
            ecclesiastical and social resonance may also work doubly: he subtly
        underscores Elizabethan courtly poetry&#8217;s implication in England&#8217;s political difficulties of
        the 1570s, represented especially by the myth of Paris and Helen (the origin of the Trojan
        War) but perhaps also by the myth of the sleeping Endymion (the lover of an Elizabeth-like
        virginal moon goddess, Cynthia), whose &#8216;cave&#8217; becomes the source of an Adamic &#8216;fall&#8217; (63-7);
        and, simultaneously, Spenser gestures to his own poetry in helping to solve such
        difficulties, as the specific artistic locale of Colin Clout throughout <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> suddenly comes into view (see <hi rend="italics">Apr</hi> 35-6 and note): &#8216;And
        they that con of Muses skill, / sayne most what, that they dwell / (As goteherds wont) upon
        a hill, / beside a learned well&#8217; (45-8). </p></note>

        purist in the tradition of Augustine and Calvin, rejecting classicism, in contrast to
        Morrell, who is a Renaissance syncretist, fusing classical with Christian, offering two
        models relating the Christian present to the classical past. At 154, Spenser, himself a
        known syncretist, subtly complicates Thomalin&#8217;s model by having the shepherd refer favorably

        <p><hi rend="italics">August</hi> is unique in <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> for its
            formal complexity--in structure, rhyme scheme, tone, and thus in function and
            significance. It becomes not merely the &#8216;ultimate comic distillation of Virgilian
            pastoral in <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes Calender</hi>&#8217; (Bernard 1989:
        68) but more precisely the book&#8217;s register for the genre of pastoral itself, unfolding the
        poet&#8217;s skilled authority before the nation. </p>
        <p>The eclogue consists of four main parts: 1) in lines 1-52, Perigot
        and Willye engage in a dialogue over Perigot&#8217;s debilitating love for a &#8216;bouncing Bellibone&#8217;
        (61) and select Cuddie as their judge for a singing contest; 2) in lines 53-124, the two
        shepherds engage in the singing contest, with Perigot voicing his suffering and Willye
        offering a response; 3) in lines 125-50, Cuddie then awards the prize to both shepherds and
        offers to &#8216;rehearse&#8217; (194) Colin Clout&#8217;s song of unrequited love for Rosalind; and 4) in
        lines 151-95, Cuddie records Colin&#8217;s song, followed by Perigot&#8217;s &#8216;admir[ing]&#8217; response (191)
        and Cuddie&#8217;s call for the shepherds to go &#8216;home&#8217; (194).</p>
        <p>Each of the four parts has its own rhyme scheme. The opening dialogue redeploys
            the six-line stanza of <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> (<hi rend="italics">ababcc</hi>), with its iambic pentameter line, although it orchestrates the layout of
            the rhyme scheme quite differently and with considerable complexity: in
        lines 1-24, Willye speaks the quatrain and Perigot the couplet; in lines 25-42, Willye
        speaks the six-line stanza twice and Perigot once; and then in lines 43-52 the shepherds
        alternate two-line units, until Cuddie concludes by voicing the stanza&#8217;s last two lines. The
        roundelay sung during the singing contest&#8212;arguably pastoral&#8217;s defining event&#8212;relies on a
        tetrameter line and consists of thirty quatrains rhyming <hi rend="italics">abab</hi>, with
        Perigot singing the &#8216;a&#8217; lines&#8217; and Willye the &#8216;b&#8217;. The follow-up conversation awarding the
        prizes and leading up to Colin&#8217;s song redistributes the six-line stanza, with Cuddie singing
        all the quatrains but one and with the other two shepherds singing the couplets. Colin&#8217;s
        song, the showpiece of <hi rend="italics">August</hi>, is an English sestina, using an
        unrhymed, iambic pentameter line spread across six stanzas, concluded with a three-line
        envoy. The form of the sestina traces to Arnaut Daniel, Dante, Petrarch, Sannazaro, and the
        French Pl&#233;iade, with Spenser and Sidney (in &#8216;Ye goteheard Gods&#8217;) vying for the title of
        English inventor, although Spenser&#8217;s sestina is the first to appear in print (cf. Shapiro
        1980). The placement of a six-stanza poem with six lines in each stanza is appropriate to an
        eclogue about the sixth month of the year, according to the old calendar, which begins in
        March (Brooks-Davies 1995: 128). Yet it was Petrarch in the <hi rend="italics">Rime
            Sparse</hi> who had featured the number six in his sestinas as a &#8216;particularly clear
        example of a cyclical form expressing the embeddedness of human experience in time&#8217;: the
        &#8216;recurrence of the six rhyme-words expresses the soul&#8217;s obsession with its inability to
        transcend time&#8217; (Durling 1976: 17). </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, as E.K. points out in his Argument, the key subtexts for <hi rend="italics">August</hi> are the singing contests in Theocritus and Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Idylls</hi> 5 and 6 and <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 3 and 7.
            While the singing contest, known as &#8216;amoeboean song&#8217;, was &#8216;destined to become a hallmark
            of the bucolic poetry of Theocritus and his imitators&#8217; (Halperin 1983: 178),
        it forms an unusually precise model for the imitative methodology of pastoral poetry. For
        the fiction of two singers competing with each other in rivalry for a prize models the way
        that pastoral poets produce their art in rivalry with preceding poets, the way Theocritus
        does with the epics of Homer (Halperin 1983: 170-89, 223-30, 237-43, 250-3). E.K.
        encapsulates this model&#8212;scripting a precise mimesis identifying imitation with
        representation--when he calls the singing contest &#8216;a delectable controversie, made in
        imitation of that in Theocritus: whereto also Virgile fashioned his third and seventh
        &#198;glogue&#8217; (Arg 1-3). </p>
        <p>The Theocritean link of pastoral with epic appears in displaced form in the
            singing contest, which notably replaces war with art, and often resolves the competition
            peacefully. The generic paradigm appears on one of the traditional prizes of the
            contest, the drinking cup, which constitutes a miniature ekphrasis (one that, for
            Theocritus, originates in the famed decorated shield of Achilles in the <hi rend="italics">Iliad</hi>, Book 18): the self-conscious artifact of the
        cup represents not merely pastoral as an art form (cf. Halperin 1983: 185-7) but the
        agonistic epic dynamic of pastoral. Thus the &#8216;mazer&#8217; that Willye offers contains two scenes,
        each representing a version of the epic dynamic of Spenser&#8217;s pastoral. The first depicts an
        ivy vine taming the &#8216;fiers warre&#8217; of &#8216;Beres and Tygres&#8217; (28)&#8212;&#8216;fiers warre&#8217; to appear in
        Spenser&#8217;s programmatic phrase for epic in the opening stanza of <hi rend="italics">FQ</hi>:
        &#8216;Fierce warres and faithfull loves shall moralize my song&#8217; (I.pr.1.9). The second scene
        depicts a &#8216;shepherd swayne&#8217; stepping in to &#8216;save&#8217; a &#8216;Lambe in the Wolves jawes&#8217;, an act of
        pastoral bravery evocative of the epic heroes of Scripture, David and Christ. When Spenser
        says that his cup is fit for &#8216;any harvest Queene&#8217; (36), he gestures to the public utility of
        his pastoral for Elizabeth (see 25-36n). </p>
        <p>Spenser&#8217;s insertion of the sestina into an eclogue with a singing contest is
            original in the pastoral tradition, and demonstrates his competitive overgoing of the
            very tradition he imitates, modeled in the way that the sestina triumphs over the
            roundelay of Willye and Perigot. Yet it is not clear how the two songs finally relate.
            Do they &#8216;occur in the same eclogue because they work out two extremes of the pastoral
            assumption that love suffering is appeased or stabilized by song&#8217; (Alpers
            1985: 92)? Or do they form evidence of Spenser&#8217;s critique of such a paradise
        principle: &#8216;erotic obsession&#8217; may be &#8216;the means to poetic expression&#8217;, but &#8216;[m]isogyny is
        the dark side of recreative narcissism&#8217; (Berger 1988: 393). However construed, the eclogue
        does create a counterpoint on the Petrarchan theme of unrequited love as it affects the
        poet&#8217;s art: between the &#8216;light-hearted . . . mock-tragic&#8217; tone of the roundelay,
        characterized by Perigot&#8217;s na&#239;ve lovelorn-ness and Willye&#8217;s splendid cynicism, and the
        &#8216;serious . . . tragedy&#8217; of the sestina (Cullen 1970: 106-7). Whereas Perigot can be spurred
        into song by Willye, Colin has abandoned his art, and thus his song can only be rehearsed
        (see Hoffman 1977: 84). The &#8216;grief becomes something of a performance art&#8217; (McCabe 1999:
        549), but that art reveals something unexpected: embedded in time amid the isolated world of
        the forest, Colin suddenly sympathizes with Rosalind, whose &#8216;voyces silver sound&#8217; (181)
        inspires his verse, which, unlike in <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> or <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, now recognizes the &#8216;misdeede, that bred her woe&#8217; (186). </p>
        <p>Unlike the woodcut for <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, the woodcut for <hi rend="italics">August</hi> is relatively straightforward, though impressively
            detailed. In the center are the three shepherds involved in the singing contest,
            shrouded by the shade of a tree amid leafy foliage, while in the foreground are the
            prizes of a &#8216;spotted Lambe&#8217; (37) and a maplewood cup or &#8216;mazer ywrought&#8217; (26). To the
            left is Venus holding the &#8216;golden Apple&#8217; that E.K. identifies in his gloss on Willye&#8217;s
            reference to the Judgment of Paris (137-8). Since Paris had awarded the fruit to the
            love goddess rather than to Juno or Athena, causing the Trojan War, the reference lets a
            tragic tenor intrude into the narrative. Likely, Spenser alludes to the marriage between
            Queen Elizabeth and the French duc d&#8217;Alen&#231;on, since August is the month of Virgo (as the
            woodcut displays) and thus of the Virgin Queen: the depiction of the danger
        of desire in the woodcut, as well as in the dialogue, roundelay, and sestina, warns
        Elizabeth against marriage in favor of virginity (Brooks-Davies 1995: 128-9). Yet one detail
        is especially striking. In the upper-left corner, a male figure walks toward a building;
        presumably, the figure is Colin Clout, returning to the &#8216;house&#8217; from which Rosalind &#8216;did
        part&#8217; (161). </p>
        <p>The detail suggests that <hi rend="italics">August</hi> is important partly
            because it includes the second of three inset-songs sung by Colin, joining the <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> lay of Queen Elisa and the <hi rend="italics">November</hi> elegy on Queen Dido; thereby, it makes apparent a central question
            raised by the <hi rend="italics">Calender</hi>: how does the &#8216;authour&#8217; of
        the &#8216;book&#8217; deploy his own self-image within the eclogue-fiction? If Colin in <hi rend="italics">August</hi> is a &#8216;failed Orpheus&#8217; (Brown 1972-3: 15), Spenser&#8217;s own
        virtuoso performance of an Orphic sestina suggests that his poetry functions as a
        &#8216;transformative . . . art&#8217; (McCabe 1999: 550), one that builds a bridge between the
        individual&#8217;s faith in nature from earlier eclogues (e.g., <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi>)
        and a transcendent vision of the divine in <hi rend="italics">November</hi> (P. Cheney 1993:
        98-100). Colin&#8217;s sympathy with Rosalind forms that bridge, represented metaphorically in his
        identification with Philomela, who has been raped by her brother-in-law, Tereus, but who
        produces piercing song out of pain: &#8216;Hence with the Nightingale will I take part, / That
        blessed byrd, that spends her time of sleepe / In songs and plaintive pleas&#8217; (183-5; see
        notes to 180-6). Remarkably, Colin feels sympathy for Rosalind despite the fact that&#8212;or
        perhaps because--his love for her remains unrequited: it is a stunning breakthrough in

        suggesting that Spenser may have added it late in the process of publication, perhaps in
        response to Sidney&#8217;s sestina, &#8216;Ye Goteherd gods&#8217;. </note>

        significant change from <hi rend="italics">June</hi> 97-101, where Colin imagines his

        This fantasy, which never materializes in the fiction of <hi rend="italics">SC</hi>,
        prepares for Colin&#8217;s identification with Philomela: &#8216;Hence with the Nightingale will I take
        part&#8217;. Philomela is the Athenian princess raped by her brother-in-law, Tereus; after she and
        her sister, Procne, take revenge on him, they escape, and metamorphose into birds:
        Philomela, into the nightingale; Procne, into the swallow. Because Philomela uses harmonious
        song to express deep sorrow, she becomes a Western icon of the poet&#8217;s power to convert
        tragedy into art. See Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Met</hi> 6.424-674; yet Spenser&#8217;s key
        source-texts are Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Geor</hi> 4.511-3; Petrarch, <hi rend="italics">RS</hi> 311; Gascoigne, <hi rend="italics">Complaint of Philomene</hi>. The <hi rend="italics">Georgics</hi> is most important for associating Orpheus, a poet who has
        lost his wife, with Philomela, a woman who has been raped, thus making Spenser&#8217;s
        representation &#8216;Orphic&#8217; (Brown 1972-3: 14-6). Yet Spenser differs from his sources in
        transposing the nightingale to pastoral, where the bird becomes especially associated with
        Colin (<hi rend="italics">Nov</hi> 25, 141, <hi rend="italics">Dec</hi> 79), and evokes a
        poet progressing from pastoral to epic (P. Cheney 1993: 98-107). The phrase &#8216;blessed byrd&#8217;
        draws attention to Colin&#8217;s sympathy with the raped nightingale and with the departed
        Rosalind (see headnote). </note>

<note target="#calender_september_headnote" type="headnote" n="">
        <p><hi rend="italics">September</hi> is the third and final ecclesiastical eclogue, following <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi>. It
        features two shepherds, Hobbinol and Diggon Davie, in a format of dialogue-and-fable first
        established in <hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi>, which had used pastoral dialogue to distinguish between the merits
        of youth and age. Here, the conversation distinguishes between Hobbinol&#8217;s contentment with
        his pastoral retreat in the paradise of an Arcadian landscape and Diggon&#8217;s bitter return to
        this locale after his sojourn to a foreign country. At issue, then, is the pastoral
        protection of a sacred place, and the shepherd&#8217;s role in it. </p>
        <p>The eclogue divides into four parts: 1) in lines 1-24, the shepherds
        greet each other and establish the terms of their different experiences; 2) in lines 25-171,
        Diggon dilates on his disillusionment over his trip, while Hobbinol provides consolation; 3)
        in lines 172-241, Diggon tells a tale that confirms his grim experience, in which the
        shepherd Roffy and his dog Lowder war against a crafty wolf; and 4) in lines 242-59, Diggon
        rejects the idea of catharsis that telling a tale can bring, while Hobbinol offers
        friendship in his cottage at home.</p>
        <p>Two key source-texts inform the dialogue: Mantuan, <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 9, which
        contrasts praise of the good shepherd with the corruption of the Roman curia; and Virgil,
        <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 1 and 9, which tell a combined story about Roman land dispossession, exile, and
        wolves. In the intersection here of Arcadian and Mantuanesque pastoral (Cullen 1970; see
        introduction), figured respectively in Diggon and Hobbinol, Spenser can be seen to temper
        &#8216;Mantuan&#8217;s tone&#8217; and recover &#8216;Virgilian pastoral&#8217;: he fuses ecclesiastical harshness and
        classical <hi rend="italics">otium</hi> (Lindheim 1994: 18). Yet Diggon&#8217;s name derives more directly from Davy Diker
        (one who builds dikes, a digger) in Thomas Churchyard&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Davy Dycars Dreame</hi> (c. 1552) and,
        before him, the &#8216;radical ploughman&#8217; from Langland&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Piers Plowman</hi>, &#8216;Dawe &#254;e Dykere&#8217; (B
        5.320), in a tradition of radical reform (Brooks-Davies 1995: 141; see J.N. King 1990: 25).
        Diggon may even function as a Langlandian figure for Churchyard himself, whose biography
        resembles Diggon&#8217;s, and who controversially used poetry to indict public leaders obliquely
        (Fleay, Var 7: 353; see Lucas 2002: 157-8). Yet Diggon differs from his specifically
        literary ancestors in both Churchyard and Langland in that &#8216;his fall into poverty is not the
        result of others&#8217; actions, namely the greed of lords and the clergy&#8217;, but rather [it is
        caused by] his own bewitchment through their guile (lines 74-5; Little 2013: 159).</p>
        <p>Recalling <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi>, <hi rend="italics">September</hi> thus takes as its primary topic the spiritual
            life of the pastor in the face of ecclesiastical corruption. At issue historically is
            &#8216;the way in which prelatical or powerful secular patrons oppress lower clergy by means
            of financial exactions against which there is no appeal&#8217; (Hume 1984: 37), as
        well as the threat of the Jesuit Mission (Cain in Oram 1989: 150). Yet once again it is not
        clear whether the &#8216;forrein costes&#8217; (28) under scrutiny target Rome or England, and
        specifically Wales (J.N. King 1990: 44), or what Spenser&#8217;s own ecclesiastical polity might
        be, and whether he belongs to the Puritan or progressive Protestant faction (Hume 1984 vs
        King 1990). Equally at issue is the role that the poet plays in rehearsing the debate: is he
        ambivalent (Cullen 1970: 62-8), or does he express an agenda siding with the mournful Diggon
        (Hume 1984: 39-40)? Complementing the ecclesiastical concerns is a social dynamic regarding
        Elizabethan economics, including &#8216;such controversial issues as vagrancy, poverty, class
        exploitation, and internal security&#8217; (Lane 1993: 132), but also, more particularly, the idea
        of a basically virtuous British &#8216;laborer&#8217; becoming &#8216;bewitcht&#8217; by the prospect of becoming
        &#8216;enricht&#8217; (74-5)&#8212;in other words, of becoming inwardly complicit in his own outward
        &#8216;poverty&#8217;, and thereby advancing a distinctly Reformation emphasis on the inward life
        (Little 2013: 156-61). </p>
        <p>More directly than any other eclogue, &#8216;<hi rend="italics">September</hi> is . . . concerned with the
            failure of communication. . . . With its emphasis on saying and missaying, <hi rend="italics">September</hi>
            paves the way for the October discussion of poetry. . . . [Diggon and Hobbinol] tend
            toward extreme positions of black-world invective and green-world idyllism&#8217; (Berger
            1988: 309, 313). In particular, the eclogue gives extreme articulation to
        the oppositions of religio-political engagement and pastoral withdrawal, preparing for the
        discussion of the responsibilities (and irresponsibilities) of poetry in the next eclogue.
        Finally, then, <hi rend="italics">September</hi> qualifies as &#8216;a virtual primer for any future author of protest
        poetry: a work that exemplifies more clearly than any other poem of its time the most
        efficacious protective strategies available for poets who wished to voice publicly their
        opinions on dangerous subjects while minimizing the threat of punishment for those opinions&#8217;
        (Lucas 2002: 161).</p>
        <p>Metrically, <hi rend="italics">September</hi> deploys the same rugged tetrameter
            couplets as <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi>, inflected with a dialect aiming to be Welsh
            but in reality more indebted to Northern and Scots idioms (Brooks-Davies
            1993: 141).</p>
        <p>The woodcut is among &#8216;the least specific of all the cuts&#8217;, as well as the most
            straightforward (Luborksy 1981: 35). Hobbinol stands to the left with the
        comfort of his fenced house behind him, while to the right Diggon (identifiable by the scrip
        or pouch at his waist) sits sprawled on the ground, a shade-tree and foliage behind him. The
        depleted nature of the sheep outside Hobbinol&#8217;s house identifies them as Diggon&#8217;s (see line
        25). Of all the other woodcuts that feature two speakers (<hi rend="italics">Feb</hi>, <hi rend="italics">March</hi>, <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Oct</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Nov</hi>, to an
        extent <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi>), <hi rend="italics">September</hi> joins only <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi> in distinguishing between a shepherd who stands and
        one who sits. Unlike Thomalin and Morrell, however, who each use their hands to gesture to
        each other, here Hobbinol alone makes the gesture, while Diggon keeps his hands at his side,
        one firmly holding his sheep-hook, his head looking up: there is separation and loss, yet a
        beckoning toward union, and steadfastness amid misfortune.</p>
        <p>At 259 lines, <hi rend="italics">September</hi> is the second longest of the eclogues (after
            <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi>), and is notable for its use of verse, dialect, narrative,
        and fable to reflect subtly on the poet-pastor&#8217;s use of free speech to write about matters
        of ecclesiastical and social concern in the developing Elizabethan state. </p></note>

        <mentioned><hi rend="italics">Diggon Davie</hi></mentioned>: Diggon is the Welsh form of
        Diccon, a nickname for Dick, Richard. Scholars agree that Diggon evokes Richard Davies,
        Bishop of St. David&#8217;s, a supporter of Archbishop Grindal and the translator of the New
        Testament and parts of the <hi rend="italics">Book of Common Prayer</hi> into Welsh (McLane
        1961: 216-34). In addition to Churchyard&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Davy Dycars Dreame</hi> and
        Langland&#8217;s figure in <hi rend="italics">Piers Plowman</hi> (see headnote), in the background
        may also be Barclay&#8217;s Amintas from Eclogue 5, who also leaves the pastoral world of
        shepherding for the town (Little 2013: 157). As such, &#8216;Diggon is a clear surrogate for
        Colin, another wayward prodigal . . . whose disaffection from the pastoral world also
        threatens to divorce him from its poetry&#8217; (Nicholson 2014: 115). Indeed, Diggon joins Colin
        as the only shepherds in <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> who follow the &#8216;formula of
        out-and-back&#8217;, in which a shepherd leaves the pastoral world for the court and then comes
        home again, to which Spenser &#8216;attached important meanings&#8217;, for &#8216;it occurs at least four
        times in his poetry&#8217; (MacCaffrey 1976: 366-7): the old hermit Heavenly Contemplation (<hi rend="italics">FQ</hi> I.x.60); Colin Clout in <hi rend="italics">Colin Clout</hi>; and
        both the Hermit and Melibee at <hi rend="italics">FQ</hi> VI.v.37 and VI.ix.24. At <hi rend="italics">Jan</hi> 50, Colin leaves the pastoral world for &#8216;the neighbour towne&#8217;
        (see note). Spenser tends to use the formula to test the limits and merits of
        disillusionment (cf. P. Cheney 1993: 49-52). </note>

        groups of speakers, each of whom levies a specific criticism against &#8216;shepheards&#8217;: 1) lines
        108-09, criticism of an arrogant and ignorant clergy; 2) lines 110-111, criticism of clergy

<note target="#calender_october_headnote" type="headnote" n="">
        <p>As the only eclogue in <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes Calender</hi> formally on &#8216;the state of Poete&#8217;
            (97), <hi rend="italics">October</hi> is striking as one of the most complex (cf. Lane 1995: 158).
        The pastoral dialogue here is indeed challenging, as two shepherds from previous eclogues,
        the younger Cuddie (<hi rend="italics">Februarie</hi>, <hi rend="italics">August</hi>), and the older Piers (<hi rend="italics">Maye</hi>), debate the highest
        stakes for poetry in 1570s England: the &#8216;place&#8217; of &#8216;pierlesse Poesye&#8217; both in &#8216;Princes
        pallace&#8217; (79-80) and in &#8216;Heaven&#8217; (54, 60, 84).</p>
        <p>As with <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, the difficulty results from failed, or obscure, narrative
            transitions among the topics that the shepherds discuss. These topics may be divided
            into four main parts. 1) In lines 1-36, Cuddie complains that he has written poetry to
            delight the youth but failed to secure the material gain required to continue writing,
            while Piers reminds him that the poet should strive for &#8216;glory&#8217; rather than &#8216;gayne&#8217;
            (20): that Cuddie should use poetic delight for ethical education, on the
        model of Orpheus&#8217;s rescue of his wife Eurydice from Hades--a proposal that Cuddie rejects:
        &#8216;But who rewards him ere the more for thy&#8217; (33). 2) In lines 37-78, Piers suggests that if
        Cuddie really wants to secure &#8216;reward&#8217; he should write the kinds of poetry that meet the
        needs of powerful patrons: he should turn from pastoral to epic but also (as <hi rend="italics">June</hi> has
        intimated) he should include love lyric as a mediating form. This advice reminds Cuddie of
        the &#8216;Romish Tityrus&#8217; (55), Virgil, who secured patronage from Maecenas to pursue a career of
        pastoral, georgic, and epic in service of Augustan Rome--a model, Cuddie adds, that no
        longer applies in England, where patronage, heroism, and poetic achievement are absent. 3)
        In lines 79-97, Piers thus raises the central question about the place of poetry at court,
        and suggests that Cuddie may need to write poetry that &#8216;flye[s] backe to heaven apace&#8217; (84).
        This final advice prompts Cuddie to recall Colin Clout&#8217;s potential to complete such a
        &#8216;famous flight&#8217; (88), if Colin&#8217;s love for Rosalind did not ground him. Cuddie&#8217;s
        recollection, nonetheless, leads Piers to identify Colin as a model for such a glorious
        ascent. 4) In lines 98-120, Cuddie then rejects the serene possibility of high flight on the
        wings of love&#8212;&#8216;All otherwise the state of Poet stands&#8217; (97)&#8212;and outlines a more violent
        model for poetic loftiness, a Horatian reliance on wine to write &#8216;stage&#8217; tragedy (112), even
        though Cuddie concludes by admitting his own inability to do so. At the end, Piers offers
        Cuddie consolation by promising to award him a &#8216;Kidde&#8217; (120).</p>
        <p>In these complex modulations, Spenser represents three basic career models
            available to the patron-seeking poet in mid-Elizabethan England: <hi rend="italics">amateur</hi>;
        <hi rend="italics">professional</hi>; <hi rend="italics">laureate</hi> (Helgerson 1983). Cuddie&#8217;s youthful poetic model of the poet
        delighting his audience with pleasant ditties corresponds to an amateur model, because he
        sees poetry as merely a pastime. Cuddie&#8217;s dramatic model, in which tragedy allows the poet
        to &#8216;compasse weightye prise&#8217; (103), corresponds to the professional, who writes primarily to
        make a living. And Cuddie&#8217;s reference to Virgil&#8217;s career corresponds to the laureate model,
        in which the poet serves the nation in the context of eternity: &#8216;So as the Heavens did quake
        his verse to here&#8217; (60). Yet Piers&#8217; insertion of love poetry into the laureate model
        (presumably as a substitute for georgic, which did not yet exist in England [A. Fowler 1982:
        240]) is innovative, showing Spenser finding a &#8216;place&#8217; for the Petrarchan lyric in the
        career of the aspiring poet: &#8216;Of love and lustihead tho mayst thou sing, . . . / So mought
        our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde&#8217; (50, 54). Moreover, Piers&#8217; suggestion that the poet
        should return to heaven when he fails to find a place in &#8216;Princes pallace&#8217; may indicate that
        Spenser himself envisions an Augustinian-based hymn as an endpoint for the poet&#8217;s career.
        Thus the dialogue dilates on the most influential classical model of a literary career
        available to English poets and shows Spenser adapting Virgil in light of both an Augustinian
        Christianity and Petrarchism. Yet the shepherds&#8217; dialogic pattern of proposal and rejection
        leaves the state of poet open-ended.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, <hi rend="italics">October</hi> &#8216;explores the stark contrast&#8217; between &#8216;the material needs of
            the poet&#8217; and &#8216;the sublime aspirations of poetry&#8217; (McCabe 1999: 559). For
        all the shepherds&#8217; worldly discussion of practicality, career, and money, they recurrently
        turn to a heighted discourse of poetic sublimity&#8212;a discourse that also characterizes the
        glossarial language of E.K. Spenser here taps into the late sixteenth-century
        experimentation with four principal forms of &#8216;aesthetic extremes&#8217;: &#8216;wonder&#8217;, &#8216;Christian
        ecstasy&#8217;, Neoplatonic &#8216;<hi rend="italics">furor</hi>&#8217;, and the &#8216;sublime&#8217; (Sedley 2005: 9, 157n17). Longinus, whose
        <hi rend="italics">On Sublimity</hi> saw seven continental editions published before 1579 (Weinberg 1950), including
        two copies of the Portus edition in a 1578 Cambridge bookshop (Leedham-Green, personal
        communication), links sublimity with all three aesthetic extremes, but shows the sublime to
        be distinctive for its commitment to confusion, ignorance, and breakdown: &#8216;Sublimity tears
        everything up like a whirlwind&#8217; (1.4, in Russell and Winterbottom 1972: 144). Thus this
        heightened poetics proceeds through metaphors of the whirlwind but also of earth-quaking
        lightning; it locates poetic excellence in a lofty style of poetry; it valorizes the
        emotions of rapture and rage, beyond reason, intoxicated; and it makes both poet and
        audience gods, not simply citizens (see Introduction). <hi rend="italics">October</hi>&#8217;s discourse recurrently
        expresses the sublime, which Longinus finds in Plato but which cannot be equated with
        Platonism (or Neoplatonism) because of its willingness to enter into the dangerous space of
        irrationality: e.g., in the dialogue, such language as &#8216;soule of sence bereave . . . quake
        his verse to here . . . climbe so hie . . . the ryme should rage . . . troublous tydes&#8217;;
        and, in E.K.&#8217;s gloss, &#8216;make men immortall . . . astonied and as it were ravished . . .
        ravished with Poeticall furie&#8217;. E.K.&#8217;s gloss on Cuddie&#8217;s emblem summarizes the sublime
        succinctly, from Longinus to Kant to Lyotard: &#8216;Poetry is a divine instinct and unnatural
        rage passing the reache of comen reason&#8217;.</p>
        <p>Spenser&#8217;s formal source-texts for <hi rend="italics">October</hi> are the two cited by E.K., Theocritus&#8217;
            <hi rend="italics">Idylls </hi>16, a pastoral complaint about the niggardliness of the tyrant Ptolemy; and
            Mantuan&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 5, a dialogue about the difficulty of writing poetry in an age devoid
            of patrons, heroes, and successful poets. Specifically, Spenser may depend on Barclay&#8217;s
            adaptation of Mantuan&#8217;s eclogue, published in 1570 in Barclay&#8217;s posthumous <hi rend="italics">Certain
            Eclogues</hi> (although written earlier in the sixteenth century), and Turbervile&#8217;s
            translation of Mantuan in 1567 (cf. Hoffman 1977: 11-29). Yet the passages
        on Virgil&#8217;s career, Neoplatonic love, Horatian wine, and Senecan tragedy (&#8216;lavish cups and
        thriftie bittes of meate&#8217; [105]) shows Spenser suturing pastoral to a wide &#8216;webbe&#8217; (102) of
        literary and philosophical intertexts.</p>
        <p>Within such a web, where is the &#8216;place&#8217; of Edmund Spenser? Is <hi rend="italics">October</hi> a &#8216;personal
            manifesto, a declaration of his own aims&#8217; (Renwick, Var 7: 374), a
        &#8216;climactic hymn to poetry&#8217; (King 1986: 397), and the &#8216;articulation of . . . a theory . . .
        [that] combines neoplatonism and traditional Horatianism along with a Christian emphasis on
        divine inspiration&#8217; (Waller 1993: 44)&#8212;in all of which the author can be seen to identify
        with Piers and with E.K? Or does the author side more with Cuddie and his fraught social
        embeddedness, disparaging Piers&#8217; Neoplatonic transcendence as escapist (Lane 1995: 158-67),
        since the Spenserian gold standard surely lies in a &#8216;poetry of virtuous action-in-the-world&#8217;
        (Montrose 1979: 49)? Alternatively, does Spenser critique both Piers and Cuddie, who share a
        na&#239;ve &#8216;golden-age sensibility&#8217;: &#8216;Cuddie withdraws in defeat while Piers converts to a
        gesture of escape&#8217; (Berger 1988: 314)? Finally, then, does Spenser present the poet as
        transcendent or contingent, writing for this world or the next, promoting citizenship or
        godhood? <hi rend="italics">October</hi>&#8217;s potency may lie in its complex use of pastoral dialogue to represent this
        very question.</p>
        <p>A version of the question arises in the woodcut, indicating once again how the
            complexity of the poet either baffled the eye of the artisan or liberated it. Standing
            in the foreground closest to the center is a figure marked as a wise and successful
            older poet: he is bearded, wears a garland, and holds out a panpipe, his
        sheep at his feet. To his right is a younger shepherd with one arm reaching out and the
        other holding a crook, his sheep also near him. Behind the younger shepherd, an indistinct
        hill looms on the horizon, a small tree at its base, while behind the older shepherd are two
        scenes: in the first, a figure walks up the steps of an imposing edifice that is part temple
        and part palace, and is overlooked by a leafy tree; and in the second, to the left, another
        figure walks toward a group of people standing beside the building. Most directly, &#8216;The
        woodcut depicts the Virgilian paradigm by showing an aged Piers as Virgil crowned with
        laurel and offering Cuddie the pastoral oaten reeds. On a hill behind Piers-Virgil is an
        empty classical temple and an Italianate palace (cf. &#8220;Princes palace,&#8221; 80 and 81). Several
        figures admire the temple, but one moves resolutely toward it and another climbs its steps.
        . . . Cuddie rejects Piers&#8217;s offer by pointing out the figure approaching the temple. . . .
        Obviously, the figure ascending to the temple of fame is Colin&#8217; (Cain in Oram 1989: 167-8;
        see Luborsky 1981: 36-9; Brooks-Davies 1995: 158). Yet the shepherd wearing the laurel
        garland may also be Cuddie, since E.K. identifies him as &#8216;the perfecte paterne of a Poete&#8217;
        (Arg), one who has &#8216;turned his back on the halls of power. . . , [and who] retains the crown
        of laurels, the sign of public status and influence&#8217; (Lane 1995: 163, 166, 228n37).
        Irrespective of which figure is which, it remains difficult to determine whether the laurel
        poet supports or rejects a public poetry of epic in favor of a private poetry of pastoral:
        is the laurel poet pointing the way to the Virgilian model or turning away from it (cf.
        McCabe 1999: 559)?</p>
        <p>As if to highlight the complexities of both the woodcut and the dialogue, <hi rend="italics">October</hi>&#8217;s verse
        form remains paradoxically clear and simple. Cuddie and Piers, for all their differences,
        share a six-line stanza adapted from <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi>, now rhyming <hi rend="italics">abbaba</hi>.</p>
        <p>The achievement of <hi rend="italics">October</hi> has long rivaled that other pinnacle of Spenserian
            pastoral authorship, <hi rend="italics">November</hi>, which E.K. finds &#8216;farre passing . . . all other the
            Eglogues of this booke&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Nov</hi> Arg). Yet in his <hi rend="italics">October</hi> gloss, E.K. says that the &#8216;style&#8217;
            in this tenth eclogue is &#8216;more loftye then the rest&#8217; (for agreements, see Craik, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi>
            7: 366; Herford, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 368; Cory, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 369). Rather than solve the
        problem of the poet&#8217;s &#8216;place&#8217; in the world, <hi rend="italics">October</hi> presents a verse prism that refracts it.
        In the end, Spenser represents, rather than reveals, the sublime &#8216;state&#8217; of poetic truth in
        1570s England.</p></note>

        <mentioned><hi rend="italics">the perfecte paterne of a Poete</hi></mentioned>: A key phrase, resonantly
        alliterative, on the central topic both of <hi rend="italics">October</hi> and <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> (cf. Montrose 1979). Once a
        variant of &#8216;patron&#8217;, the word &#8216;paterne&#8217; suggests both a &#8216;shape&#8217; and a &#8216;model&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi>)&#8212;a shape
        with a specific design and a model to be imitated because it is worthy (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi>)&#8212;while &#8216;perfect&#8217;
        records the truth-value of the exemplar. E.K. sees the perfect pattern in a person, a
        &#8216;Poete&#8217;, suggesting that Cuddie is both an excellent poet and worthy of emulation by others.
        E.K.&#8217;s identification of Cuddie as a perfect pattern of a poet contradicts the eclogue
        itself, for Cuddie&#8217;s presence here (and throughout <hi rend="italics">SC</hi>) evokes a popular youthful poet of
        misguided ambitions--a model for no one. E.K. was the first to speculate on who Cuddie
        represents: &#8216;I doubte whether by Cuddie be specified the authour selfe . . . some doubt that
        the persons be different&#8217; ([1]). As such, Cuddie functions as a surrogate for both Spenser
        and Colin (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 374-6): &#8216;Through this complex presentational device, Cuddie is made to
        stand in relation to Colin as Colin stands to [Spenser]&#8217; (McCabe 1999: 559).</note>

        <mentioned>Cuddie <hi rend="italics">. . . better melodie</hi></mentioned>: In the first
        half of the dialogue, Spenser &#8216;imitates&#8217; Mantuan, <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 5, a
        debate between a younger shepherd, Candidus, and an older patron, Silvanus. In particular,
        Spenser borrows three topics from Mantuan, as well as from Barclay&#8217;s adaptation: &#8216;the
        poverty of poets because of niggardly patrons; the absence of heroic figures about whom
        poets can write inspired poetry; and the difficulty of finding a mode appropriate to the
        historical moment. . . . Spenser, Mantuan, and Barclay . . . derive a model relationship
        between poet, patron, and historical moment from Virgil&#8217;s poetic progression under Maecenas&#8217;
        (Hoffman 1977: 16). In keeping with Renaissance theories of imitation, Spenser both follows
        Mantuan and Barclay and radically changes them, as registered in notes below. In general,
        where Mantuan and Barclay fixate on the poet&#8217;s sour complaint against poverty, Spenser
        devotes much of his attention to the high art of poetry. </note>

        <mentioned><hi rend="italics">All as . . . did tame</hi></mentioned>: E.K. The story of
        Orpheus and Eurydice is a &#8216;myth of the power of poetry over the law of death&#8217; (Lotspeich,
            <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 381). Key versions of the myth appear in <hi rend="italics">Georgics</hi> 4.453-527, <hi rend="italics">Culex</hi> 268-95
            (which Spenser translates at <hi rend="italics">VG</hi> 449-80); and Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Met</hi> 10.1-77. Piers neglects to mention that Orpheus <hi rend="italics">fails</hi> to rescue his wife from Hades; but there is a technical
            accuracy to what Piers says, since Orpheus does succeed in charming Pluto and
            Proserpine: only when the musician breaks the divine decree not to look back
            at his wife (&#8216;withouten leave&#8217;) does he lose her for good. Spenser may &#8216;pointedly and deliberately reject . . . Virgil&#8217;s innovation [of featuring Orpheus&#8217; failure] and look beyond him to the earlier state of the myth&#8217;, according to which Orpheus succeeds in recovering Eurydice (Pugh 2016: 36).  Even so, Spenser&#8217;s representation
        is fraught with ill omen via &#8216;balefull&#8217; and &#8216;hellish&#8217;. He will go on to refer to the Orpheus
        myth throughout his poetry (e.g., <hi rend="italics">Time</hi> 332-3; <hi rend="italics">Ep</hi> 16; <hi rend="italics">FQ</hi> IV.ii.1; <hi rend="italics">HL</hi> 234-5). On
        the myth generally, see Segal 1989. On the myth in Spenser, see Cain 1971; Loewenstein 1986; P. Cheney 1993. </note>

        generic progression from pastoral (<hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi>) through georgic (<hi rend="italics">Georgics</hi>) to epic (<hi rend="italics">Aeneid)</hi> first appears in
        a four-line verse prefacing the <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi> since Roman times: &#8216;I am he

        neighboring fields to obey the husbandman, however grasping, a work pleasing to farmers: but
        now I turn to Mars [war]&#8217;. These lines established a paradigm for the poetic career. Cf.
        Mantuan, <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 5.86-8, perhaps the first European pastoral
        recording the Virgilian career: <hi rend="italics">Tityrus (ut fama est) sub Maecenate
            vetusto / rura, boves et agros et Martia bella canebat / altius et magno pulsabat sidera

        countryside, of the oxen and fields, and of the wars of Mars; and with his mighty song he
        battered the heavens&#8217;; trans. Piepho). Barclay scrambles the sacred order by putting georgic
        before pastoral (Hoffman 1977: 19): &#8216;And Titerus (I trowe) was this shepherdes name, / I
        will remember alive yet is his fame. / He songe of fieldes and tilling of the grounde, / Of
        shepe, of oxen, and battayle did he sounde. / So shrill he sounded in termes eloquent, / I
        trowe his tunes went to the firmament&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 4.411-6). It is
        appropriate to make Virgil the central exemplar of the poet in <hi rend="italics">October</hi> because he was born in this month. Spenser opens <hi rend="italics">FQ</hi> by announcing his own progression from pastoral to epic (I.pr.1). </note>

        (Brooks-Davies 1995: 164); but, as an object that Colin &#8216;admire[s]&#8217;, it means beauty, the
        face of the beloved as it reflects the divine, referring to Rosalind (Shore 1985: 57).
        &#8216;Spenser probably means Elizabeth as Venus Coelestis, whom, according to Ficino, &#8220;dwells in
        the highest, supercelestial zone of the universe, i.e., in the zone of the Cosmic Mind, and
        the beauty symbolized by her is the primary and universal beauty of divinity&#8221;&#8217; (Cain in Oram
        1988: 168, quoting Panofsky 1962: 142). Ficino had featured the image of the mirror: &#8216;the

        Soul, and the [material] Body of the World&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Commentary</hi> 5.4; quoted
        McCabe 1999: 562). The &#8216;phrase may be intended to suggest that Colin will find his true

        premier activity of Elizabethan intellectual culture (Esler 1966), evoking both heroic
        achievement and dangerous overreaching, epitomized in the myths of Icarus and Phaethon. Yet
        the concept of winged aspiration is also the mark of the classical sublime in Lucretius,
        Virgil, and Horace (Hardie 2009: 201), Roman authors who attach to aspiration the very
        metaphors of ascent that Piers voices: &#8216;climbe so hie . . . lyftes him up . . . rayse ones
        mynd . . . above the starrie ekie . . . lofty.&#8217; Only later in the first century AD will
        Longinus call such aspiration the sublime, centering it in Homer, Plato, and the Greek
        tragedians, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, as well as Sappho. </note>

        when Piers promises to award Cuddie a &#8216;Kidde&#8217; for his lofty attempt (a promise that recalls
        the Greek festivals where tragedians competed publicly for awards). That Cuddie wins a prize
        in a competition of one is in keeping with Spenser&#8217;s treatment of this youthful shepherd, a
        complex blend of sympathy and humor. Alternatively, Piers may offer the kid because he
        considers himself Cuddie&#8217;s competitor. Like many of the fictional transitions in the

        <p> E.K. is the first to assign special status to <hi rend="italics">November</hi>, saying in the Argument
            that Spenser &#8216;farre pass[es] . . . his reach, and in myne opinion all other the Eglogues
            of this booke&#8217;. <hi rend="italics">November</hi> is indeed &#8216;the grandest poem in the sequence&#8217; (Alpers
            1972: 367): it features the &#8216;sacred mystery of death and rebirth&#8217;, as
        Spenser &#8216;reevaluat[es] . . . the whole enterprise [the poet&#8217;s career] in the light of
        eternity&#8217; (Montrose 1979: 51-2).</p>
        <p>Structurally, the eclogue divides into three parts. In lines 1-52, the shepherd
            Thenot asks Colin Clout to sing one of his famous songs, whether a love song to Rosalind
            or a hymn to Pan; but Colin refuses because the autumnal season &#8216;nis the time of
            merimake&#8217; (9); Thenot agrees, and requests a song on the death of the recently deceased
            Queen Dido--a request that Colin grants. In lines 53-202, Colin then delivers a
            fifteen-stanza funeral elegy, in which he mourns the tragedy of Dido&#8217;s death but then
            suddenly witnesses her ascent into the afterlife: &#8216;I see thee blessed soule,
        I see, / Walke in the Elisian fieldes so free&#8217; (178-9). Finally, in lines 203-8 Thenot
        praises the &#8216;doolfull pleasaunce&#8217; of Colin&#8217;s song (204), and awards Colin a lamb.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">November</hi> relates to previous Colin Clout eclogues: to <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> and
        <hi rend="italics">August</hi>, for reprising a song about desire, thereby connecting Dido with Rosalind; to <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi>,
        for presenting a tragic version of the epideictic celebration of a maiden queen, connecting
        Dido with Elisa; and to <hi rend="italics">June</hi>, for offering a heightened meditation on the poet&#8217;s career. Yet
        <hi rend="italics">November</hi> also joins <hi rend="italics">October</hi> and <hi rend="italics">December</hi> in forming a three-eclogue conclusion to <hi rend="italics">SC</hi>;
        together, they present &#8216;Spenser&#8217;s trilogy . . . on poetry and its present state&#8217; (Bernard
        1989: 75).</p>
        <p>In particular, <hi rend="italics">November</hi> shows Spenser writing in the pastoral tradition of
            funeral elegy. This tradition begins with Theocritus, <hi rend="italics">Idylls</hi> 1, an elegy on the dead
            shepherd Daphnis, in a tradition that goes on to include both Bion&#8217;s elegy on the dying
            Adonis and Moschus&#8217; elegy on Bion. But Spenser&#8217;s two key source-texts are Virgil,
            <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi> 5, and especially Marot&#8217;s elegy on the death of Queen Louise of France, mother
            to Marot&#8217;s patron, Francis I, <hi rend="italics">Eglogue sur le Trespas de ma Dame Loyse de Savoye</hi> (1531)
            (Hoffman 1977: 53-61; for details on Marot, see Reamer 1968/9). Petrarch,
        Boccaccio, and Sannazaro had all written elegies as part of their pastorals, helping to
        Christianize the form that Marot and Spenser inherit. As a tradition, these elegies combine
        a rich philosophical and religious mythology of pastoral, poetry, and politics, and they
        follow a similar two-part structure: initial grief over loss of a beloved person, followed
        by consolation through the person&#8217;s apotheosis (Sacks 1985; Pigman 1985; Kay 1990; see P.
        Cheney 2003).</p>
        <p>To accomplish his &#8216;grand&#8217; goals, Spenser uses three sets of verse
            forms: for the opening dialogue, an eight-line stanza rhyming <hi rend="italics">ababbcbc</hi>; for
        Colin&#8217;s song, a ten-line stanza alternating four kinds of lines&#8212;alexandrine, pentameter,
        tetrameter, dimeter&#8212;with four interlocking rhymes, <hi rend="italics">ababbccdbd</hi>; and for Thenot&#8217;s coda, a
        sixain, rhyming <hi rend="italics">ababcc</hi>. Of the most spectacular of the three forms, Colin&#8217;s song, Herford
        writes, this &#8216;admirable strophe of his own invention . . . conveys the expression of a
        recurring access or wave of emotion, marked at the outset (in a highly original manner) by
        the energetic and resonant Alexandrine, then gradually subsiding through verses of
        diminishing compass, until just before the close it rises in one expiring palpitation&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi>
        7: 397).</p>
        <p>Despite this <hi rend="italics">tour de force</hi>&#8212;or perhaps because of it&#8212;<hi rend="italics">November</hi> is difficult to
            gauge. Does Spenser&#8217;s commitment to &#8216;transcendence&#8217; substantiate the Christian poet&#8217;s
            wisdom&#8212;his use of art to express faith in the truth of a scriptural heaven (MacCaffrey
            1969: 127-9, 132-3; Moore 1982: 113-4)&#8212;or is such transcendence &#8216;escapist&#8217;
        (Montrose 1979: 50-4; Berger 1988: 399, 409, 414-5)? Alternatively, does the center of
        <hi rend="italics">November</hi> lie elsewhere, not in the &#8216;image&#8217; of &#8216;Dido in heaven&#8217; but rather in &#8216;Thenot&#8217;s words
        of thanks to Colin&#8217; at the end&#8212;that is to say, in Spenser&#8217;s attention to community,
        contingency, and song, as the poet directs his gaze at this world, not the next (Alpers
        1972: 363)? To the extent that the eclogue valorizes transcendence, it serves the
        &#8216;Augustinian&#8217; goal of a &#8216;celestial pastoral&#8217;, fulfilling &#8216;the function of funeral rites&#8217; in
        society (Cain in Oram 1989: 185-6); but to the extent that <hi rend="italics">November</hi> seeks a &#8216;performance&#8217;
        goal in a &#8216;pastoral of power&#8217;, it advertises contingency in the politics of Spenser&#8217;s
        unfolding career (Montrose 1979: 51).</p>
        <p>Significantly, the woodcut supports the latter possibility, for it pushes the funeral
        procession marching to the church bearing the bier of Dido into the background, and centers
        rather on Thenot&#8217;s crowning of Colin with the laurel garland. Hence, the poet plays his
        pipe, with his sheep grazing before him, while behind him stands a building representing the
        court.</p>
        <p>In such a courtly, vocational setting, who is Dido? The name derives from the
            tragic Carthaginian queen of Virgil&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Aeneid</hi>. While Spenser&#8217;s Dido may represent someone
            in the family of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, as evoked through reference to &#8216;the
            greate shepheard <hi rend="italics">Lobbin</hi>, how great is thy griefe&#8217; (113) (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 395-402),
        inescapably the &#8216;mayden of greate bloud&#8217; (Arg 1-2) evokes Queen Elizabeth: in this veiled
        political allegory, she would be dead to Leicester and Protestant England if she married the
        Catholic Duc d&#8217;Alen&#231;on (Parmenter, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 402; McLane 1969: 47-60; McCabe 1999: 565-6;
            Prescott 2010: 620-2; Pugh 2016: 145). The allegory about the death of a queen may also gesture to
        violations of the 1571 statute that illegalizes attempts on the queen&#8217;s life: Elizabeth&#8217;s
        &#8216;divine status is subtly but definitively reserved for her death&#8217; (Lane 1993: 24). Yet the
        elegy&#8217;s &#8216;celebration of Dido&#8217;s life&#8217; (Cullen 1970: 92n29) does not square with such a grim
        political critique. Dido may refer less to Virgil&#8217;s tragically passionate heroine than to an
        alternate tradition of a chaste queen devoted to her dead husband&#8217;s memory (Bono 1984: 67-9;
        see D. Cheney 1989: 155): &#8216;Spenser&#8217;s interest [is] in recuperative interpretations of
        Virgil&#8217;s female characters. He introduces Dido in &#8220;November&#8221; not to subvert his earlier
        tributes to Elizabeth but to suggest another way of representing relationships between the
        sexes in Virgilian poetry&#8217; (Watkins 1995: 79-80).</p>
        <p>What is striking about <hi rend="italics">November</hi>, then, is its interplay between the ominous
            political allegory, on the one hand, and, on the other, its sublime intertextual fiction
            of both chaste communal desire in this life and Christian transcendence in the next&#8212;as
            well as one inescapable fact: in 1579, Spenser boldly presents his pastoral
            persona as the creator of this interplay.</p></note>

Marot, <hi rend="italics">Eglogue sur le Trespas de ma Dame Loyse de Savoye</hi>. <hi rend="italics">November</hi> constitutes a careful imitation of Marot&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Eglogue</hi> (Reamer 1968/9; Prescott 1978: 10-12): Spenser borrows the
        main frame of the fiction, along with several of its details; but he changes Marot
        radically. In particular, he borrows the fiction of a male poet singing a two-part funeral
        elegy on the death of a beloved queen (lamentation at her death followed by joy at her
        immortality), punctuated by a refrain, as well as the introductory and concluding dialogue
        between two shepherds named Thenot and Colin, the first an inferior poet awarding a prize to
        the second, superior one. Yet Spenser changes Marot most glaringly by concealing the overt
        national topicality of the elegy, including the dead queen&#8217;s identity. Whereas Marot
        situates the pastoral fiction in &#8216;France&#8217; (142, 151, 218), and names members of Francis I&#8217;s
        royal family (both his mother &#8216;Madame Loyse&#8217; [title] and her daughter &#8216;Margot&#8217; (Marguerite
        de Navarre [60, 109]), Spenser nowhere mentions England (or even Kent), and he conceals the
        identity of the deceased queen. This changes the nature of the fiction from panegyric to
        (likely) allegory (see 67n) but also the self-presentation of the poet himself. Whereas
        Marot clearly presents himself as the nation&#8217;s premier funeral poet to his king&#8212;he is
        patriotic, sympathetic, learned, artful&#8212;Spenser accepts this role but adds to it that of
        royal counselor, warning Elizabeth about a dangerous French alliance. In this way, E.K.&#8217;s
        reference to Immerito&#8217;s imitation of a French poet gestures to a French political context
        and opens the way to an English one. (Other debts and changes appear below.) </note>

        Mopsus, if you have any strains on your flame Phyllis, or in praise of Alcon, or in raillery

        satire&#8212;Spenser identifies two: love lyric and hymn--songs addressing an earthly beloved and
        a deity. In <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi>, Colin turns from singing love songs to
        Rosalind to singing a hymn to Pan, although in <hi rend="italics">November</hi> Pan
        signifies principally Christ (Berger 1988: 414). The phrase &#8216;higher vaine&#8217; puts the two

        goes further by drawing attention to the poet&#8217;s special relationship with the queen. In <hi rend="italics">SC</hi>, Spenser uses the word &#8216;sovereign&#8217; at <hi rend="italics">Feb</hi>

        <mentioned><hi rend="italics">Up then . . . verse</hi></mentioned>: Colin&#8217;s song divides
        into two sections, adapting the convention of the funeral elegy: in the first eleven
        stanzas, he mourns Dido&#8217;s death; in the last four, he witnesses her soul breaking from its
        corpse to ascend to heaven. In the first section, Colin addresses several figures (his Muse,
        the shepherds, the shepherds&#8217; daughters, Lobbin); he recalls Dido&#8217;s care of her shepherds,
        including himself; he witnesses various figures in nature weeping over her loss (from
        flocks, forest beasts, and the dove and nightingale to water nymphs, the Nine Muses, and the
        Three Fates); and he offers a meditation on the transitoriness of all &#8216;earthly things&#8217;
        (153). In the second section, he bursts out in joy at seeing Dido&#8217;s resurrection; he
        re-addresses Lobbin; he describes Dido walking in the Elisian fields; he sees death as a
        good; and he calls on his song to cease its mourning and find joy in Dido&#8217;s sainthood.
        Altogether, the song serves the social and psychological function of the funeral elegy as a
        literary form, the &#8216;work of mourning&#8217; (Sacks 1985; cf. Kay 1990), self-consciously
        identified in its penultimate line: &#8216;my woe now wasted is&#8217; (201; see note). While an elegy
        about a queen named Dido carries the valences identified in the headnote, it also has
        application to Spenser&#8217;s unfolding career: &#8216;The death of Dido . . . stands for the death of
        an ideal that Spenser will write a Virginian epic for England&#8217; (Helfer 2012: 131; cf. Horton
        1996: 113-4). </note>

        place, the Elysium Fields with the Champs-&#201;lys&#233;es in Paris (which is named after the Elysium
        Fields). In classical culture, the Elysium Fields were a divine abode of heroic individuals
        but also a place of immortalizing song (Homer, <hi rend="italics">Od</hi> 4.563; Hesiod, <hi rend="italics">Works and Days</hi> 170; Pindar, <hi rend="italics">Odes</hi> 2.59-75;

        &#8216;Elisa&#8217;, connecting Dido with Queen Elizabeth (cf. Berger: &#8216;Elisa . . . centers and embodies
        Elisium&#8217; [1988: 410]). Like Marot, Spenser politicizes the afterlife in terms of the nation,
        but he adds the word &#8216;free&#8217;, making the Elisian Fields a place of eternal freedom (see
        Introduction and notes below). </note>

<note target="#calender_december_headnote" type="headnote" n="">
        <p>In <hi rend="italics">December</hi>, Spenser ends <hi rend="italics">The Shepheardes
            Calender</hi> as he began it: with an eclogue about the solitary figure of the
        shepherd-poet Colin Clout. As in <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi>, Spenser tells a two-part
        story, with an opening frame spoken by a narrator (this time, one stanza instead of two),
        giving way to a long lament sung by Colin himself (the number of lines for the eclogue
        doubles, from 76 to 158). As in <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> as well, Spenser uses a
        sixain stanza in both the narrative frame and the song, rhyming <hi rend="italics">ababcc</hi>, in generally iambic pentameters&#8212;a conjunction that once again draws
        attention to the interconnectedness between author and persona. The return to the form and
        format of <hi rend="italics">Januarye</hi> sets the terms for genuine complexity: does the
        artistic principle of recursion show Colin trapped within the calendric cycle of nature,
        taking him down the path to death? Or does it show the poet released into the perfect circle
        of immortality? An answer to this question is important for the <hi rend="italics">Calender</hi> as a whole. </p>
        <p>Primarily, the question results because Spenser juxtaposes a fiction about Colin&#8217;s
        maturation from the spring to the winter of his life with a second fiction, told by
        &#8216;Immerito&#8217;, which emerges in the 12-line Epilogue printed after the Glosse (see note below
        on Epilogue). The author of the book proclaims that he has written an immortalizing
        &#8216;Calender for every yeare&#8217;, one that &#8216;shall continue to the worlds dissolution&#8217;: &#8216;That
        steele in strength, and time in durance shall outweare . . . / . . . if I marked well the
        starres revolution&#8217; (1-4). The claim of the Epilogue is the grandest that poetry can make,
        for &#8216;the master topos of post-classical European literature [is the] unprecedented union . .
        . of subjective vision and objective fact&#8217; (Braden 1999: 60). In this topos, on display from
        Dante to Milton, the poet presents his poem as an artifact in the shape of the cosmos; he
        compares his own &#8216;poetic production&#8217; with &#8216;that of the creator of the universe&#8217; (Curtius
        1953: 400; see 379). In <hi rend="italics">December</hi>, the key becomes whether to
        interpret Colin&#8217;s song in and of itself, as its own artifact, exhibiting the poet&#8217;s failure
        on the road to death, or to place Colin&#8217;s song within the larger frame of Immerito&#8217;s work,
        in which poetry qualifies as a cosmological art having a cosmological function. For a
        conclusion to Spenser&#8217;s inaugural publication, the juxtaposition of a fiction of death with
        a fiction of immortality should hardly be surprising. Spenser makes it clear that he throws
        down the gauntlet, to England, to the international community, and to Western poetry, in
        defense of poetry&#8217;s vital role in time and beyond it.</p>
        <p>Yet it proves challenging to interpret the double-fiction. In the eclogue fiction, is Colin
        in a moribund state of &#8216;despondency&#8217; (Cullen 1970: 79-81) singing an &#8216;elegy for himself&#8217;
        (McCabe 1999: 570; see McCabe 1995: 39-40) modeled on Ovid&#8217;s myth of Narcissus (Johnson
        1990: 109-14); or is Colin in a mature state of resignation before he dies (Montrose 1979:
        62; Moore 1982: 112-5; Shore 1985: 94-102; Cain in Oram 1988: 201-2)? From the perspective
        of the Epilogue, how does Spenser as an author relate back to Colin as a character? Does
        Spenser use Colin with his &#8216;pathological pleasure in the rhetoric of self-pity&#8217; to transact
        a &#8216;metapastoral critique&#8217; of a failed art (Berger 1989: 387, 379); or does Spenser
        &#8216;transform . . . what might have been a despairing epitaph into a celebration of artistic
        achievement&#8217;, asserting &#8216;the triumph of art over time&#8217; (McCabe 1999: 571). </p>
        <p>In the eclogue proper, Spenser imitates Marot&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Eglogue au Roy soubz les
            noms de Pan et Robin</hi> (1539). On the one hand, Spenser borrows the French poet&#8217;s
        basic narrative conceit, the poet&#8217;s review of his life as the passing of the four seasons,
        as well as considerable detail for each season (see individual notes below). On the other
        hand, Spenser once more changes Marot considerably (see 1-18n). For instance, the French
        persona figure, Robin, directs his song to his patron, Pan, in order to address Francis I,
        who at the close of the eclogue gives the poet royal patronage. In this way, <hi rend="italics">Eglogue au Roy</hi> transacts a successful model relating poet and
        sovereign, showing the poet to be a monarchical dependent, and the sovereign willing to
        advance that dependency (Marot barely mentions Robin&#8217;s love-life). In contrast, Colin does
        not address Queen Elizabeth, who has no formal role in his song; instead, Colin relieves
        Rosalind of blame and engages in &#8216;self-reliance&#8217;, lending &#8216;semi-divine status&#8217; not to the
        monarch but to the poet (McCabe 1995: 39). </p>
        <p>How, then, are we to read the politics of poetry in <hi rend="italics">December</hi>, with
        its &#8216;greene cabinet&#8217; (17) as at once the Elizabethan cabinet of government and the artifact
        of this cabinet made by the poet (see 17n)? Are we to &#8216;translate . . . a personal
        explanation of Colin&#8217;s melancholy into a national one&#8217;, seeing <hi rend="italics">December</hi> as &#8216;a pastoral of state&#8217; addressing &#8216;those in power&#8217; but offering &#8216;two
        versions of nationalism, that which could be expressed in whole-hearted appreciation of
        Elizabeth, and that which admitted the anxieties of the Protestant activists grouped around
        Sidney, Leicester, and Walsingham&#8217; (Patterson 1987: 124, 119, 121); or are we to see &#8216;Colin
        less as Spenser&#8217;s mouthpiece than as his target&#8217;, since Spenser writes &#8216;a political critique
        of paradisal poetics&#8217;, with its misguided yearning for Edenic repose (Berger 1988: 386)?
        Perhaps we are to turn the formulation around: &#8216;it is the private dimension of public grief
        that is characterized in Colin&#8217;s melancholy&#8217; (McCabe 1995: 40).</p>
        <p>The woodcut suggests this latter reading, because it features a &#8216;portrayal of personal
        desolation, a stark image of the despondent &#8220;ego&#8221; that haunts Arcadia&#8217; (McCabe 1995: 40). In
        particular, the woodcut shows Colin sitting in his signature locale, beside a stream and
        under a shade tree, with his flock scattered before him. Yet directly behind him is a tall
        mountain, from which the sun radiates brightly (whether rising or setting); <hi rend="italics">December</hi> is only one of three woodcuts to include the sun (the
        others are <hi rend="italics">Aprill</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maye</hi>), and it is the
        only woodcut to place the orb directly in the center of the picture. The mountain is
        arguably Mount Parnassus, the place of higher poetry, especially epic. Three other notable
        features appear. First, to the far left is a path leading from Colin and his sheep to a
        small building, which may be the &#8216;home&#8217; referred to at the conclusion of ten of the twelve
        eclogues (but not <hi rend="italics">December</hi>), or perhaps the &#8216;house&#8217; of Rosalind in
        Colin&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">August</hi> sestina (161; see 181). Second, a &#8216;water tank&#8217; sits
        in the right foreground, beside Colin, with its &#8216;leonine gargoyles . . . suggest[ing] . . .
        a diminishing of the monarchical lion inherited by the Tudors from Aeneas&#8217;s descendent
        Brutus&#8217; (Brooks-Davies 1995: 188), a political detail noticeably absent in the eclogue
        itself. And third, equally curious, is a broken pipe lying on the ground near Colin&#8217;s feet,
        similarly contrasting with the eclogue&#8217;s fiction, which shows Colin hanging his pipe in a
        tree. </p>
        <p>This last image&#8212;which is the crowning action of the eclogues&#8212;epitomizes <hi rend="italics">December</hi>&#8217;s complexity, because it leads in different directions (see 141n). At the
        end, does Colin renounce his career as a public poet, or does Spenser renounce his career as
        a pastoral poet in order to move on to epic? The Epilogue suggests the latter, for it is
        &#8216;written in &#8220;epic&#8221; hexameters and describ[es] . . . [Spenser&#8217;s] accomplishment as if it were
        already a canonical text&#8217; (Kinney 2010: 163). In <hi rend="italics">December</hi>, then, as
        especially in <hi rend="italics">June</hi> and <hi rend="italics">October</hi>, Spenser both
        complicates a Virgilian career and transacts it. More accurately, perhaps, Spenser uses
        pastoral to heighten the drama around Immerito&#8217;s fitness to become England&#8217;s new poet.</p></note>

    E.K.s gloss (17) refers to &#8216;a bla&#383;ing [&#383;t]arre&#8217;. Moreover other
    variants in outer forme M, most notably the correct designation of this

    designated in state 1) confirm &#8216;blasinge&#8217; as the corrected reading.

        which Robin compares with the <hi rend="italics">verte maison</hi> (green house) of the

        word &#8216;cabinet&#8217; has three meanings: 1) &#8216;a rustic summertime bower&#8217;; 2) &#8216;a private chamber of
        the privileged, for reading, writing, or keeping one&#8217;s treasures&#8217;; and 3) &#8216;a private place
        for conducting business, especially of state&#8217; (Patterson 1987: 107-8; see also 128-30). For
        Marot, the green cabinet is &#8216;a symbol both of intellectual privacy and of artistic liberty&#8217;
        (Patterson 1987: 114). For Spenser, the cabinet is principally the private, secret cabinet
        of the English secretary, trained to keep secrets for the politically powerful, as Spenser
        was doing as secretary to John Young, Bishop of Rochester, while writing <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> (Rambuss 1993: 29-61; see esp. 48-9). Notably, the &#8216;greene cabinet&#8217; is Pan&#8217;s,
        and Colin calls on the god to &#8216;Hearken&#8217; to his &#8216;rurall song&#8217; from the arboreal locus,

        epic, associated with imperial power (see <hi rend="italics">Feb</hi> 102-114n, <hi rend="italics">Nov</hi> 125n). Like the swallow, the raven has both classical and
        biblical associations. See Virgil <hi rend="italics">Ecl</hi> 9.14-6, where Moeris says to
        Lycidas, <hi rend="italics">quod nisi me quacumque novas incidere lites / ante sinistra cava
            monuisset ab ilice cornix / nec tuus hic Moeris, nec viveret ipse Menalcas</hi> (&#8216;So,
        had not a raven on the left first warned me from the hollow oak to cut short, as best I
        might, this new dispute, neither your Moeris here nor Menalcas himself would be alive&#8217;). See
        also 1 Kings 17:6 where the Lord tells Elijah that ravens will care for him, as well as Luke
        12:24 when Christ says, &#8216;Consider the ravens: for they nether sowe nor reape: which nether
        have store house nor barne, &amp; yet God fedeth them: how muche more are ye better than
        foules&#8217;. If for Virgil the raven is a bird of prophecy serving the shepherd-poet, in
        Scripture the raven is a sign of God&#8217;s providential care for the faithful. The image of the
        youthful Colin robbing the oak tree of its raven&#8217;s nest may signify the folly of premature
        epic ambitions. For direct allusion to those ambitions, see 43-8 and note. </note>

        One of the most enigmatic of Colin&#8217;s utterances, combining two acts by Marot&#8217;s Robin, who
        used his bow to shoot down nuts from trees and climbed other trees to thrown down the nests
        of jays and pies, so that his companions below could reap the benefits. Colin says that he
        climbed the oak to rob the raven of its nest (see 31-2n) and used &#8216;many a stroke&#8217; to
        &#8216;wearie&#8217; the &#8216;stately Walnut tree&#8217;, while down below &#8216;the rest&#8217; (evidently, his companions)
        fell at &#8216;strife&#8217; over the &#8216;nuts&#8217; he dropped. Metaphors of politics and government intrude.
        First, the walnut tree is &#8216;stately&#8217;, a word that nominally means &#8216;tall&#8217; and &#8216;dignified&#8217; but
        also &#8216;of the state&#8217; (see <hi rend="italics">Oct</hi> 112n about the &#8216;stately stage&#8217; of
        tragedy). The walnut, like the oak, is a tree of political power (see 33n below), and
        Colin&#8217;s wearying of it with his stroke suggests a na&#239;ve art addressing government, one that
        evidently causes civil &#8216;strife&#8217;. </note>

        Colin has listened &#8216;tomuch&#8217; to his &#8216;peers&#8217;, who have praised him (39), corresponding to the
        idea that a poet is made by his reputation in society; and 3) Colin has been educated by
        &#8216;Wrenock&#8217; (41), corresponding to the idea that a poet is made by learning. The three
        possibilities enlarge the famous question of whether a poet is born or made; see note in <hi rend="italics">Nov</hi> Arg on &#8216;no arte, but a divine gift&#8217;. Cf. Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Ecl</hi> 9.32-4<hi rend="italics">: et me fecere poetam / Pierides, sunt

        stanza out as a &#8216;fine description&#8217;. It records the change in Colin&#8217;s life via two metaphors.
        In the first, where once Colin sought the bee making its honeycomb, now he finds an ugly
        toad lording over its stool. The honeybee is a figure for civic order (Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Aen</hi> 1.430-6) but also for lyric poetry (Plato, <hi rend="italics">Ion</hi> 534A; Philostratus, <hi rend="italics">Imagines</hi> 2.12; cf. Frye 1963: 69;
        Alpers 1972: 366-7; Hoffman 1977: 42). In contrast, the toad is a figure of poison, which
        suggests the evil with which <hi rend="italics">SC</hi> opens, &#8216;Envie&#8217; (&#8216;To His Booke&#8217; 5),
        arch-enemy of the poet, perhaps alluding topically to Alen&#231;on, whom Elizabeth called her
        Frog (Adler 1981; see <hi rend="italics">Dec</hi> 70n). In contrast, the owl is a
        traditional figure of ill-omen (Isa 34:15), and is such always for Spenser (see <hi rend="italics">June</hi> 24 and note). Todd may be right that &#8216;ynne&#8217; is a &#8216;Cambridge
        phrase . . . by the students to signify the apartments which they inhabit&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 423); but the word also puns on <hi rend="italics">inwardness</hi>, the &#8216;ghastlie&#8217; condition of melancholy and envy that threatens the
        poet&#8217;s springtime poetry. </note>

        during the spring Colin wandered out of doors into the natural world, during the summer he
        spent his time pursuing industrious projects connected with architectural forms: the formal
        rooms of the honeycomb; the grievous inn kept by the owl; the sheepcotes; and the

        suggests knowledge of, respectively, cosmology, cartography, and topography. Spenser&#8217;s
        details nonetheless evoke traditional roles for the poet: as a cosmologist, he is able to
        read the signs of the zodiac (83-4; see Richardson 1989); as a cartographer, he is able to
        chart the ocean (cf. Helgerson 1992: 149-91); as a prophet, he is able to read the signs of
        birds (cf. A. Fletcher 1971); and as a physician, he is able to use herbs to heal the
        stricken (cf. P. Cheney 1993: 135-6)&#8212;this last being specified in the next stanza with
        respect to the illness of eros that plagues Colin. Cf. Marot, <hi rend="italics">Eglogue au

        fall of his life, Robin sees his bagpipe hung in a tree, which emphasizes his lack of poetic
        productivity, while at the end, in the winter, he tells Pan/Francis I that he will take the
        bagpipe down from the tree to honor him with new songs. Yet in the first instance (158-61)
        Robin says he will honor his beloved by hanging his pipe in a tree as a challenge to poetic
        rivals. In <hi rend="italics">Arcadia</hi>, Sincero/Sannazaro uses the figure twice at the
        end (Nash, Chapter 10, p. 105; Epilogue, p. 152) to signal the poet&#8217;s Virgilian turn from
        pastoral to epic. In <hi rend="italics">Shepheards Garland</hi>, Drayton interprets Colin&#8217;s

        Hamilton 1968: 35; Cullen 1970: 79; Montrose 1979: 61-2). Spenser will replay versions of

  <p>Known as a &#8216;square poem&#8217;, this twelve-line verse with each line having twelve

        &#8216;frame&#8217;) builds the poem out of the twelve months and squares it &#8216;for every yeare&#8217;. Cf.
        Puttenham, <hi rend="italics">Arte of English Poesie</hi> (1589) 2.12, which identifies the
        &#8216;Quadrangle Equilater&#8217; as a poem using &#8216;no more verses than your verse is of syllables&#8217;, and

            quadratum</hi>, &#8220;a square man.&#8221;&#8217; Spenser&#8217;s stanza consists of six epic hexameter
        couplets (see <hi rend="italics">December</hi> headnote). The textual status of the Epilogue
        is uncertain. 1579 and all the early quartos that follow it print it after the <hi rend="italics">December</hi>
        Glosse, a position of acute subordination, as if the original compositor did not know where it
        belonged. Yet the poem itself constitutes a remarkable claim of authorial autonomy. In
        particular, it does three things. First, it claims the status of immortality for the
        artwork, strong enough to endure &#8216;till&#8217; the Last Judgment (1-4). Second, it asserts the
        work&#8217;s Christian authority for teaching good shepherds how to feed their flock and protect
        it from evil (5-6). Third, it gives a &#8216;free passporte&#8217; to the &#8216;Calender&#8217; to join an
        international community of works and authors from antiquity and the Middle Ages, even as it
        modestly admits its humility before their &#8216;high steppes&#8217; (7-12). Viewed from this
        perspective, the Epilogue contradicts its position in the text; yet viewed in light of the
        modesty topos controlling the claims, the subordinate textual position seems not just
        appropriate but precise, forming yet another instance of this author&#8217;s self-protection (see
        7-12n below). As with so much of <hi rend="italics">SC</hi>, the textual position of the
        Epilogue invites interpretation. Most importantly, its position harks back to the close of
        &#8216;To His Booke&#8217;, as if confirming the success that was still in doubt there, so that reading
        the poem seems to enact a triumphant public reception of it.</p>

        &#8216;Calender&#8217; into a perfect circle, an emblem of immortality. Yet the self-quotation is itself
        an imitation, from Chaucer, <hi rend="italics">Tr</hi> 5.1786-92: &#8216;Go, litel bok, go, litel
        myn tragedye, / Ther God thi makere yet, er that he dye, / So sende myght to make in som

        the steppes where as thow seest pace / Virgile, Ovide, Omer, Lucan, and Stace&#8217;. In turn,
        Chaucer imitates Statius, <hi rend="italics">Thebiad</hi> 12.810-9, especially 816-9: <hi rend="italics">vive, precor; nec tu divinam Aeneida tempta, / sed longe sequere et
            vestigia semper adora. / mox, tibi si quis adhuc praetendit nubila livor, / occident, et
            meriti post me referentur honores</hi> (&#8216;Live, I pray; and essay not the divine Aeneid,
        but ever follow her footsteps from afar in adoration. Soon, if any envy still spreads clouds
        before you, it shall perish, and after me you shall be paid the honours you deserve&#8217;).
        Finally, several British poets before Spenser imitate Chaucer, including Lydgate, <hi rend="italics">Troyboke,</hi> &#8216;Lenvoye&#8217; 92-107, <hi rend="italics">Falls of Princes</hi>
        3589-3604; James I of Scotland, <hi rend="italics">Kingis Quair</hi> 1352-79; Skelton, <hi rend="italics">Garland of Laurel</hi> 1533-86. From Chaucer forward, the conceit tends
        to show the poet not simply imitating other poets but fictionalizing his response to them:
        he humbly admires their achievement, but he boldly seeks to place himself in their company.
        Whereas Chaucer lists the poets in his personal canon, Spenser is more enigmatic, relying on
        fictional names that make identification difficult: &#8216;Tityrus . . . Pilgrim . . . Ploughman&#8217;.
        The names bridge the divide between classical and medieval eras and literary forms, but,
        unlike Chaucer&#8217;s group, Spenser&#8217;s does cohere in forming an advertisement for a pastoral
        poetry of Christian worship and Protestant reform (see individual notes below). </note>

        &#8216;[P]assporte&#8217; has two interrelated meanings: a government license to travel safely in a
        foreign country, and, more broadly, a guarantee of safe conduct. Both apply to Spenser&#8217;s
        phrase, the first important because it refers to the rights of the citizen, specifying it
        with respect to travel and international relations. In Immerito&#8217;s poem, however, it is not
        the monarch who gives the &#8216;free passporte&#8217;, and it is not the subject who receives it.
        Spenser rewrites law, turning the poet into a figure of authority, perhaps because he is
        &#8216;sovereigne of song&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Nov</hi> 25): he makes the poem itself the free
        citizen able to travel abroad; and he converts European nations into the international
        community of immortalizing poets. Virgil, Chaucer, and the rest are immortalizing because
        their community of poets spans not just place but time. In short, Spenser stakes out the
        freedom of a Christian poet to traverse the controversial topics of the nation. The phrase
        may also allude to Ovid&#8217;s exile (see Pugh 2005: 17-18, as well as 37-8 on the Ovidian nature
        of the Epilogue as a whole). </note>

        <mentioned><hi rend="italics">Pilgrim . . . Ploughman playde a whyle</hi></mentioned>: An
        ambiguous formulation: most directly, authors of <hi rend="italics">The Pilgrim&#8217;s Tale</hi>
        and <hi rend="italics">The Plowman&#8217;s Tale</hi>, works thought to be written by Chaucer and
        printed as his in sixteenth-century editions of his works. Yet the phrase &#8216;playde a whyle&#8217;
        suggests Spenser&#8217;s skepticism about Chaucer&#8217;s authorship (Renwick, <hi rend="italics">Var</hi> 7: 428). The &#8216;Ploughman&#8217; may also evoke Langland&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Piers
            Plowman</hi>. It is hard to tell who the three figures identified refer to, the other
        being &#8216;Tityrus&#8217;. Irrespective of who is who, the lines advertise Spenser&#8217;s affiliation with
        a &#8216;[Protestant] poetry of social and religious protest&#8217;, especially on display in the
        ecclesiastical eclogues (<hi rend="italics">Maye</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Julye</hi>, <hi rend="italics">September</hi>): &#8216;The ideal poet presented in <hi rend="italics">The
            Shepheardes Calender</hi> is a Protestant heroic poet who aspires to court favour but
        retains a measure of prophetic independence&#8217; (Norbrook 2002: 53, 80). </note>

        imitation: Spenser both adores his precursors and follows them far off. The word &#8216;followe&#8217;
        is a technical term for literary borrowing, while &#8216;steppes&#8217; forms one of the primary
        metaphors of literary imitation, connected to the familiar pun on &#8216;foote&#8217; (<hi rend="italics">Dec</hi> 116), including in Horace and Ovid (Hinds 1987: 16). Moreover,
        &#8216;high&#8217; refers to both the elevated status of the imitated authors and their style, known as
        the &#8216;sublime&#8217; style in sixteenth-century poetics (Ascham, <hi rend="italics">Scholemaster</hi> 58^r^). &#8216;A more disarming assertion of greatness would be hard to
        imagine&#8217; (D.L. Miller 1979: 227). </note>

        because it appears after his Epilogue as the conclusion of the book, and unfolds three
