            ancient, but antique be’ (43-4). This wordplay introduces an ambiguity that runs
            throughout the proem, which pretends to worry about whether Spenser’s fiction possesses
            the dignity and authority of antiquity or is merely a gothic extravagance.

            commonly transfers epithets, here from ‘none’ to ‘aire’, and of the distinctive quality
            this freedom lends to the verse: half-animating the air itself, such phrasing

            ‘discovered’, it also suggests the activities of conjecture, interpretation,
            declaration, and, of course, construal of a text. Its range is suggested by the way

            12-15. Spenser fuses these more or less playful references with an echo of Heb 11:1:
            ‘Now faith is the grounde of things, which are hoped for, and the evidence of things
            which are not sene’; the rest of chapter 11, an extended definition of faith, is evoked
            more broadly in the proem. Hamilton 2001 also notes a reminiscence of Giordano Bruno’s
            astronomical speculations in the 1584 treatise <hi rend="italic">De l'Infinito Universo e Mondi</hi>
            (‘On the Infinite Universe and Worlds’). This fusion of literary, religious, and

        4.1-5  The keen-scented hound tracking textual "feet" is a Renaissance commonplace
            applied to the seeker of rare manuscripts or to the humanist editor filling in

            canvassed extensively in Italian Renaissance criticism, passes into travel narratives
            and other New World discourses as a trope of discovery (Greenblatt 1992). Spenser’s
            proem has evoked the wonder of geographical discovery in a characteristically ambiguous
            register, half-serious and half-playful, that lends this phrase its edge of irony: the
            reader who would ‘wonder’ at newly discovered worlds (3.9) should not wonder at the
            inadequacy of his common sense to apprehend the marvels of Spenser’s text.

        <mentioned>sence</mentioned>: Powers of interpretation (cf. 2.1, ‘with better sense’,
            and 3.4, ‘witless man’), but playing also on the five senses, or ‘wits’ and the ‘common
            sense’ that synthesizes them (thus Thomas Wilson 1553 says that ‘The common sense...is
            therefore so called, because it geveth judgement, of al the five outwarde senses’
            [112]). These ‘outward’ or bodily senses were contrasted with the ‘inward sense’, i.e.
            faculties of mind or spirit. This ambiguity concentrates into a single word the playful
            pretense that Faeryland is a geographical location like Peru, able to be discovered by
            the outward senses, rather than a textual ‘place’ (4.2n) accessible only to the
            intellect.

            parallel to those of ‘red’, ‘place’, and ‘sence’. The line may thus be paraphrased ‘That
            can’t track fancy (poetic) footwork without a bloodhound’. In 1596 Spenser will repeat
            the pun on ‘footing’, referring to Faeryland as ‘these strange waies, where never foote
            did use, / Ne none can find, but who was taught them by the Muse’ (VI.pr.2.7-9).

        <mentioned>fayrest</mentioned>: Spenser more than once links ‘faery’ (4.1, 8) to
            ‘fayre’ (4.7) and ‘fayrest’ as if it expressed the comparative degree of a beauty whose
            superlative is embodied in the queen (cf. 1.pr.2.5). This ambiguity cuts against the
            wordplay elsewhere in the proem that tends to <hi rend="italic">disembody</hi> Faeryland, and thus
            implies that it can be ‘red’ in both senses (intellectually as well as corporeally; see
            4.4n) only in Elizabeth.

            simplicity is complicated by the association between ‘fayre’ and ‘Faery’, by the
            implication that Elizabeth is the mirror in which Faeryland may be ‘red’, and by the
            assertion in the immediately following lines that Faeryland reflects the past as well as
            the present.

        4.7-9 According to early modern constitutional theory, the monarch possesses two
            ‘bodies’: the personal body of the mortal individual and the undying ‘body politic’,
            through which the monarch personifies the realm. These lines evoke the body personal in
            Elizabeth’s ‘face’ and the body politic in her ‘realmes’, concluding with her lineage,
            which traces the genealogy of each.

            face to temper the ‘glory’ or radiance that shone from it after he spoke with God (Exod
            34:30). At 2 Cor 3:13 St. Paul reinterprets the passage allegorically, suggesting that
            what Moses hid was not the radiance but its fading. If there is also a glance at the
            legal term <hi rend="italic">femme covert</hi> (the legal status, or rather non-status, of a married
            woman), it would carry strong irony, given the queen’s unmarried state. Both <hi rend="italic">vele</hi>

            allegory in particular.

            (continuing the pretense from st. 1 that fiction is somehow disreputable), in contrast
            to the rhyming use (at 5.5) as illumination. But the paradox of ‘shadowes light’
            reintroduces the sense of illumination as a secondary reference, and it thus plays
            against the superficial sense of ‘light’ as trivial.

        Guyon: The name may come from heroes of French romance, particularly the medieval
            metrical romance <hi rend="italic">Guy of Warwick</hi>, where the name ‘Guy’ is regularly varied to
            ‘Guyon’ for rhyme; Guy’s two-part career, as questing knight and then as pilgrim, offers
            a template for the pairing of Guyon and the Palmer in Book II (King 2007). Guy was
            especially well known because the English earls of Warwick, Robert and Ambrose, claimed
            descent from him (Cooper 2007: 185). The name also echoes Gihon, one of the four rivers
            of Paradise, associated with Temperance (Fowler 1960), and may additionally, as Camden
            thought, recall Ital <hi rend="italic">guido</hi> guide (1605:82). In the <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend</hi> it is

            suggesting that Temperance will ‘appear’ to the inward rather than the outward senses.
            This suggestion is reinforced by the rhyming partner ‘heare’(5.8), since hearing Guyon’s
            adventures is an activity of the common sense whereas the rule of Temperance can appear
            only to the intellect (see 4.4n).

            (also, no doubt, ‘dexterously’), but the word combines complex senses related to the

        <mentioned>doe dew</mentioned>: This homophonic doubling signals the pervasive
            concern of Book II with obligation, the performance of revenge, and the conspicuously
            unstated alternative of baptism, figured in Redcrosse’s combat with the dragon as balm
            flowing from a tree that ‘overflowed all the fertile plaine, / As it had deawed been
            with timely raine’ (I.xi.48.4-5). The repetition here introduces ‘dew’ as a key term,
            repeated at 22.9, 25.4, 28.9, 40.6, 47.7, 57.5, 60.7, and ii.1.2, all in variations on
            the sense of obligation or propriety. This series culminates in the Palmer’s reference
            to fountains ‘from their source indewd’ with secret powers, and ‘with moisture deawd’
            (ii.6.1, 4), which returns to the baptismal ‘dew’ of I.xi.48, but in a mystified,
            paganized version.

        20.5 Guyon seems to be tripping over his proverb. The distinction between ‘wrongs’ that
            can be mended and ‘shame’ that cannot be is difficult to apply to a wrong that shames
            the victim: cf. 17.8, ‘her wrong through might’, 18.2, ‘who hath ye wrought this
            shamfull plight’, and 20.7, where Guyon invites the lady to ‘see the salving of your

        <p>32.6-8 See 7.9n and 26.5n. Having got off on the wrong foot, Guyon here starts over from
            the proper ‘marke’. ‘Race to ronne’ recalls the language of steps, haste, and delay that
            pervades the episode. It also echoes 1 Cor 9:24, ‘Knowe ye not, that they which runne in
            a race, runne all, yet one receiveth the price? so runne, that ye may obteine’, and Heb
            12:1-2, ‘Wherefore, let us also, seing that we are compassed with so great a cloude of
            witnesses, cast away everie thing that presseth downe, and the sinne that hangeth so

            hardly fail to recall that much of what he did, he did as he ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. His
            language may therefore be truer than he knows: not only ‘attribute nothing more than

        34.7-9 These lines epitomize the moral lesson of the episode. The pairing of
            ‘intemperaunce’ with ‘wrath’ suggests the traditional distinction between concupiscible
            and irascible passions (those caused by pleasure, such as lust, and those caused by
            pain, such as wrath). Duessa’s role in provoking Guyon, preceded by Archimago’s vivid
            description of her violent rape, demonstrates how intimately the two passions may be
            related.

        <p>st. 36-56 The episode of Mortdant and Amavia has been persuasively interpreted as an
            allegory based on the Pauline account Mosaic law in Romans 7 (Kaske 1993, 1999). The
            principal characters appear to be derived from the 1576 Geneva glosses to Romans.
            Chapter 7 opens with a similitude meant to explain the dominion of the Law over a man
            ‘as long as he liveth’:</p>
        <p>2. For the woman which is in subjection to a man, is bounde by the law to the man, while
            he liveth: but if the man be dead, she is delivered from the law of the man.</p>
        <p>3. So then, if while the man liveth, she take another man she shalbe called an
            adulteresse: but if the man be dead, she is free from the Law, so that she is not an
            adulteresse, though she take another man.</p>
        <p>4. So ye, my brethren, are dead also to the Law by the body of Christ, that ye should be
            unto another, even unto him that is raised up from the deade, that we should bring forth
            fruite unto God.</p>
        <p>Amavia, refusing to be delivered from ‘the law of the man’, remains bound to Mortdant
            under the Law even after his death. The gloss to Romans 5:14 contains a similar hint for
            the character of Ruddymane. The verse reads, ‘But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even
            over them also that sinned not after the like maner of the transgression of Adam, which
            was the figure of him that was to come’. The ‘like maner of the transgression of Adam’
            refers to enacted sin; the verse asserts that, by virtue of original sin, death reigned
            even over those who personally committed no transgression. The gloss explains, ‘he
            meaneth yong babes, whiche neyther had the knowledge of the law of nature, nor any
            motion of concupiscence, much lesse committed any actuall sinne’. </p>

            his mistresses’ (31-32). Hadfield and Maley 1997 add that ‘the bloody hand is the

        40.5-9 Editors have seen these lines as echoing Ezek 16, where the personified ‘word of
            the Lord’, instructing the prophet to ‘cause Jerusalem to knowe her abominacions’,
            declares: ‘And when I passed by thee, I sawe thee polluted in thine owne blood, and I
            said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Thou shalt live: even when ye wast in thy
            blood, I said unto the, Thou shalt live’ (16:1-2, 6). The Geneva gloss reads in part:
            ‘whereby is ment that before God wash his Church, and give life, there is nothing, but
            filthines and death’. This would associate Ruddymane with the Pauline subject prior to
            baptism, but a more likely reference for the episode is found in the Geneva gloss to
            Romans 5:14 (see st. 36-56n), which associates Ruddymane with the subject not only prior
            to baptism but ‘without the Law’. Spenser may also be recalling Gower’s <hi rend="italic">Confessio
                Amantis</hi>: ‘The child lay bethende in hire blod / Out rolled fro the moder barm, /
            And for the blod was hot and warm, / He basketh him aboute thrinne’ (3.312-15).

        <mentioned>yett being ded</mentioned>: The phrase works in overlapping grammatical
            constructions: (1) ‘rosy red did paint his cheeks, yet [despite his] being dead’; and
            (2) ‘yet [despite his] being dead, he seemed to have been a goodly personage’. The
            phrase sits oddly at the stanza’s pivot point (line 5), but rather than turning from
            life to death or from appearance to reality, the lines sustain a gruesome incongruity.
            First Amavia’s blood, soiling the grass and besprinkling her lover’s armor, contrasts
            with the blood still animating his ‘ruddy lips’ and ‘red . . . cheekes’; then the false
            appearance created by this coloring is dispelled by the qualification ‘yett being ded’,
            followed by the past tense of ‘Seemd to have beene’—only to return in the next line’s
            description of him as ‘Now in his freshest flowre’. The reference to ‘loves rage’
            returns us to Amavia and her fury in preparation for the adversative of the alexandrine
            (‘But that’), which reasserts the actuality of the knight’s death. This
            dissonance-effect carries over from the description of the bloody babe in the second
            half of st. 40.

        53.5-7 Lucina is the Roman goddess of childbirth and hence a poetic term for ‘midwife’.
            To say that ‘she came’ and that Amavia’s midwives were ‘the Nymphs’ is either literally
            true or, more likely, a euphemistic way of saying that there was no midwife. The

        St. 60-61 The act of burial corresponds to the office of the sixth beadman in the House

            practice. In 61 his oath of vengeance and his ritual mingling of blood, earth, and hair
            strongly mark the pagan character of his ‘Religious reverence’ (59.6), and of his
            response to the episode more broadly. This emphasis on pagan ritual and revenge sorts
            oddly with Guyon’s recognition at 27.6 of ‘The sacred badge of my Redeemers death’ on

        2.7-8 Cf. John 15:6, ‘If a man abide not in me, he is cast forthe as a branche, and
            withereth’. Guyon’s conclusion (‘Such is the state of men’) might seem to assume the
            absence of grace, in contrast to the implications of the phoenix; like the texture of
            allusion to Romans in this and the previous canto, the metaphor of the babe as a branch
            torn from its trunk—in contrast to the conventional image of the genalogical
            tree—depicts life itself as a form of death.

        St. 3-4 The image of the phoenix (2.6) recalls the well in which Redcrosse is restored at
            I.xi.29-30 (cf. the simile comparing the ‘new-borne’ knight to an Eagle at I.xi.34).
            Guyon’s failed effort to wash the baby’s hands in this well has been diversely
            interpreted as an allegory of baptism and of Mosaic Law. See <hi rend="italic">The Thirty Nine
                Articles</hi> IX, on original sin; XVI, on sin after baptism; and XVIII, on the
            insufficiency of the Law for salvation. Paul discusses these topics in Rom 5-7; see esp.
            6:2-4: ‘Howe shall we, that are dead to sinne, live yet therein? Knowe ye not, that all
            we which have bene baptized into Jesus Christ, have bene baptized into his death? We are
            buried then with him by baptisme into his death, that like as Christ was raysed up from
            the dead to the glorie of the Father, so we also should walke in newnesse of life’. The
            language and imagery of these cantos suspend Temperance in the interval between
            baptism-into-death and resurrection into newness of life.

        21.5-9 The anticlimax of ‘to understond’ emphasizes the comedy of Guyun’s rushing in

            ‘pacifie’ the combatants—not ‘as well he can’ (which the meter would favor), but ‘well
            as he can’, which turns out to be not very well. Having lost his horse and borne his

            which means ‘bearing’. At <hi rend="italic">Aen</hi> 1.405, Aeneas recognizes the disguised Venus by her

        <p>St. 22-31 These ten stanzas comprise a blazon, or formal pictorial description of female
            beauty. The primary motive is honorific, but satiric touches can be discerned. The
            passage interweaves echoes from Tasso’s <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo</hi>, Ariosto’s <hi rend="italic">OF</hi>, Virgil’s
                <hi rend="italic">Aen</hi>, and Song Sol, which Ponsonby in 1591 (<hi rend="italic">Complaints</hi>, ‘The Printer to
            the Gentle Reader’) says he ‘understands’ Spenser to have translated, although no such
            text survives.</p>
        <p>The Virgilian echoes come from separate but related passages. They include details from
            the description of Venus as she appears to her son <hi rend="italic">virginis os habitumque gerens et
                virginis arma</hi> (‘with a maiden’s face and mien, and a maiden’s arms’; <hi rend="italic">Aen</hi>
            1.315): <hi rend="italic">namque umeris de more habilem suspenderat arcum / venatrix dedratque comam
                diffudere ventis, / nuda genu nodoque sinus collecta fluentis</hi> (‘For from her
            shoulders in huntress fashion she had slung the ready bow and had given her hair to the
            winds to scatter; her knee bare, and her flowing robes gathered in a knot’; <hi rend="italic">Aen</hi>
            1.318-20). These details link Belphoebe also to Diana, whom Venus partly impersonates
            with her virginal disguise; thus when Virgil compares Dido to Diana later in Book 1, the
            description echoes that of Venus: <hi rend="italic">illa pharetram / fert umero gradiensque deas
                supereminet omnis</hi> (‘she bears a quiver on her shoulder, and as she treads
            overtops all the goddesses’; 1.500-501). Spenser mingles both passages in the blazon,
            suggesting that Belphoebe (and allegorically, Elizabeth) combines the beauty of Venus
            with the chastity of Diana.</p>

            something to Song Sol 5.10, ‘My welbeloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest of ten

            to Elizabeth of both divinity and the power to convey it to her beholders comes
            perilously close to blasphemy—or mockery. As Sidney in the <hi rend="italic">New</hi>

        24.1-6 Presumably Love has not yet engraved any triumphs in the broad, white expanse of
            Belphoebe’s forehead, since her face remains ‘withouten . . . blot’ (22.3) and the
            infinitive verbs (<hi rend="italic">for Love . . . to engrave, / And write</hi>) suggest rather an

            compares Alcina’s <hi rend="italic">fronta lieta</hi> (‘serene brow’) to <hi rend="italic">terso avorio</hi> (‘polished
            ivory’; <hi rend="italic">OF</hi> 7.11.7). Tasso mentions Clarise’s <hi rend="italic">fronte d’avorio</hi> (‘brow of
            ivory’; <hi rend="italic">Rin</hi> 1.55.5), while of the Queen of Media he says, <hi rend="italic">Sembrava a lei

        27.7-9 As Hamilton 2001 notes, this description suggests virginity (‘that none might

        31.7-9 According to Apollodorus, Proclus, and other classical sources, Penthesilea was

            her sister Hippolyte while hunting (the fate that threatens Braggadocchio in Spenser’s

            account of the Renaissance literary and pictorial tradition to which Lucian’s brief

        <p>st. 4-5 Spenser’s allegorical portrait of the ‘wicked Hag’—not named until the Palmer
            identifies her as Occasion at 10.9—draws upon literary and iconographic traditions for
            several related figures, including Occasion, Penitence, Fortune, Envy, Discord, and
            Punishment. Within these traditions, the attributes, appearances, and accoutrements of
            such figures continually alter as the concepts they embody are redefined. Kiefer (1979),
            for example, describes the gradual conflation of Fortune with Occasion in the
            literature, emblems, paintings, and <hi rend="italic">imprese</hi> of the Italian Renaissance, as the
            medieval view of an arbitrary force imposed upon largely passive victims yields to a
            rival conception of Fortune as a variable set of conditions to be met and mastered by
            the resourceful human agent.</p>
        <p>Occasion is regularly depicted in emblems as a naked young woman with winged heels, not a
            lame hag clothed in rags. The lameness of Spenser’s hag in 4.3 may echo a verse from
            Horace used by Van Veen in <hi rend="italic">Horatii Flacci Emblamata</hi> (Plate 27a): <hi rend="italic">raro
                antecedentem scelestum / deseruit pede Poena claudo</hi> (‘Punishment with her lame
            foot rarely forsakes the fleeing criminal’; <hi rend="italic">Odes </hi>III.ii.31-32); it may also echo
            Homer, who says that the sharp-tongued detractor Thersites was ‘bandy-legged and lame in
            one foot’ (<hi rend="italic">Il</hi> 2.217). See <hi rend="italic">Var</hi> 2.225-27 and Manning and Fowler (1976).</p>
        <p>Beyond these echoes, Spenser recombines elements from at least three sources, Lucian,
            Ausonius, and Boiardo. From Lucian he takes the image of the young man dragged by the
            hair—transferring it from Calumny, a beautiful woman, to his ‘mad man’. (The theme of
            calumny will resurface when this young man’s story is revealed). Unlike Calumny,
            Spenser’s ‘wicked Hag’ comes stalking <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the young man dragged by his hair, in
            the place of Lucian’s Penitence. As a provocateur in this oddly trailing position, she
            reflects a persistent motif in canto iv wherein temporal sequences are reversed.</p>
        <p>In Ausonius, Epigram 33, <hi rend="italic">Occasio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Metanoea</hi> (Regret) appear together as a
            before-and-after pair. Boiardo offers a similar conception: Orlando, failing to grasp
            the forelock of Fata Morgana, is set upon by a hag with a flail who identifies herself
            as ‘Penitenza’ (<hi rend="italic">OI</hi> II.ix.1-20). The forelock is a familiar attribute of Occasion,
            as in the proverb ‘Seize occasion (opportunity, time) by the forelock’ (Smith 1970, no.
            777) and in the emblem tradition illustrating it, e.g. Whitney’s <hi rend="italic">In occasionem</hi>:
            ‘What meanes longe lockes before? <hi rend="italic">that suche as meete / Maye houlde at firste, when
                they occasion finde. </hi>/ The head behinde all balde, what telles it more? /
                <hi rend="italic">That none shoulde houlde, that let me slippe before</hi>’ (lines 9-12; see
            arg.2n).</p>
        <p>Spenser joins the forelock of opportunity to the abusive speech of Calumny, the
            ‘vengeaunce’ visited upon her victims by Punishment, and the trailing position of
            Penitence. This conception mingles figures of consequence with those of cause,
            suggesting, for example, a connection between the youth dragged along by his hair in st.
            3 (consequence) and the forelock (st. 4) by which ‘cause is caught’ (44.6). This
            compounding of before-and-after reflects the broad irony by which characters in the
            canto, having mistaken an allegorical figure for the <hi rend="italic">causes</hi> of wrath (arg.2n) as
            the conventional emblem of an <hi rend="italic">opportunity</hi> to be grasped, find themselves pursued
            by the uncontrolled fury they have sought (cf. 32.1n).</p>

        10.2-5 Echoing the equivocations at 3.2 and 3.5, the Palmer tells Guyon that he only
            ‘seems to see’ Furor. Having personified both Furor and Occasion as embodied agents
            whose features, actions, and accoutrements call for interpretation, the allegory now
            insists they are not <hi rend="italic">really </hi>embodied agents after all. Spenser’s allusion to the
            ‘Calumny of Apelles’ topos, with its emphasis on the artistic processes of embodiment
            and depiction (see 3.5-7n), anticipates this self-conscious undoing of personification.
            The Palmer’s decoding sheds light as well on the motif of inverted cause and consequence
            (st. 4-5n), which complements the transposition of self and other whereby Guyon misreads
            his own affective state as an embodied adversary (8.8-9n).

            is <hi rend="italic">Erebus</hi>, generally the region of the underworld. Hesiod, <hi rend="italic">Theog</hi> 123-25,
            makes Erebus and Night the children of Chaos. In making Erebus the son of
                <hi rend="italic">Aeternitie</hi>, Spenser may be adapting Boccaccio (<hi rend="italic">Gen Deor </hi>1.1), who
            derives Night from Herebus and Litigium (Jarre), who in turn derive from Demogorgon and
            Aeternitie.

        <p>44.1-7 The Palmer’s comment in these lines brings out the implicit irony of an
            allegorical figure who combines the iconography of strife with that of opportunity

            Pyrochles, does strife appear as an opportunity to be ‘caught’ by the forelock. The
            rhyming pair ‘seeke’ and ‘followes eke’ (like the epithet ‘mad man’, repeated from 3.5)

            ‘What dismall day hath lent but this his cursed light’, a reading that is both
            nonsensical and hypermetrical; 1596 revises to ‘What dismall day hath lent this cursed
            light’. There is no evidence as to whether the change is compositorial or authorial; we
            take it to be compositorial, and prefer to correct by removing ‘but this’. It is
            possible that the untenable 1590 reading resulted from a two-stage misconstrual of
            manuscript copy. If Spenser originally wrote ‘What dismall day hath lent vs [or ‘his’]
            cursed light’, and then added ‘this’ and ‘his’ [or ‘vs’] side by side above the line as
            possible replacements, the compositor could have misconstrued the unfinished revision as
            an insertion (stage one misconstrual). At the same time, he misread ‘vs’ as ‘but’: the
            heavily inked descender on a secretary hand ‘v’ makes it possible to read it as a ‘b’,
            and Spenser’s own terminal ‘s’ resembles the rounded form of a terminal ‘t’.

            it as the name of one of the fallen angels and, from the New Testament context, the god
            of earthly wealth’ (8.1-2n). Where the Geneva Bible translates ‘Ye can not serve God and
            riches’ (Matt 6:24, Luke 16:13), the Bishops’ and other Elizabethan bibles read ‘God,
            and mammon’. Spenser’s conception of Mammon as both a god of riches and an underworld
            deity probably reflects the influence of Boccaccio, <hi rend="italic">Genealogia</hi> 8.6, which
            conflates Pluto, the classical god of the underworld, with Plutus, the god of riches;
            Conti distinguishes the two but does mention that Strabo identified Pluto as the god of
            wealth (<hi rend="italic">Myth</hi> 250). The descent to Mammon’s cave blends allusions to the hero’s
            descent to the underworld in classical epic (e.g. <hi rend="italic">Od</hi> 11 and <hi rend="italic">Aen</hi> 6),
            Satan’s temptation of Jesus in the wilderness (Matt 4:1-11, Luke 4:1-13), and a number

            Typically Polaris, in the constellation Ursa Minor (also referred to as the lodestar,

            in the indefinite pronoun might reflect awareness that the identity of the star closest
            to the pole depends upon the position of the observer in space and time. Thus Taylor
            1971 reports the common belief that the southern hemisphere also had a fixed star to
            match Polaris in the north, the idea being that these two stars were like the ends of
            the earth’s axis (or “axle”) and provided similar navigational aid in their respective
            hemispheres (162). If Mammon’s cave is deep enough, there might be a reminiscence of

            was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.’ The
            gloss to the New International Version notes that the Greek for ‘tempted’ can also mean
            ‘tested’.

        St. 46 The ‘great gold chaine’ held by the ‘woman gorgeous gay’ (44.6) alludes to the

            from heaven (<hi rend="italic">Il</hi> 8.18-27). The image gains historical resonance as both classical
            and, later, Christian commentators interpret it as a symbol of cosmic order. Lotspeich
            1932 cites as precedents for Spenser’s use of the image Plato, <hi rend="italic">Theat</hi> 153D;
            Boethius, <hi rend="italic">Cons Phil</hi> 2.meter.8; Chaucer, <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi> 3.1744-1771, and <hi rend="italic">CT

            linking the virtues and their patron knights in an alliance of ‘noble mindes’. His use
            of the symbol here to suggest avarice follows Conti in combining both
            interpretations.

        St. 60 See 59.2n above; in this stanza one ambiguity is resolved—Tantalus is told to ‘be’
            an emblem—while another ambiguity opens up. In 1590 Guyon instructs Tantalus to be an
            emblem of ‘mind more temperate’, whereas in 1596 and 1609 the instruction reads
            ‘Ensample be of mind intemperate’. Either version can make sense: Tantalus may be an
            emblem of intemperance punished, but if he does ‘abide the fortune’ of his ‘present
            fate’, he may become an example of ‘mind more temperate’.

        1.1 <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> glosses the exclamatory use of ‘and’, ‘expressing surprise at, or asking
            the truth of, what one has already heard’. Spenser intensifies the sense of wonder by
            opening with the device, leaving unstated ‘what one has already heard’. A possibility
            would be 1 Pet 5:7, ‘Cast all your care on him: for he careth for you’. Contrast Virgil,

            zeugma draws ‘our’ militancy together with ‘theirs’ (the function of grace according to
            Calvinist doctrine). On spiritual warfare, see 2 Cor 10:4: ‘the weapons of our warrefare
            are not carnal’. Reformed theology distinguished between the Church Militant, comprised
            of Christians on earth engaged in combat against sin, and the Church Triumphant,
            comprised of those in heaven who have triumphed over sin. Cf. Eph 6:11-12: ‘Put on the

            For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,

        <mentioned>Not to debate the chalenge of your right</mentioned>: To ‘challenge right’
            is to lay a claim to, or assert a right, so that ‘not to debate the chalenge of your
            right’ means ‘not to take up the claim (of right) that you have laid/entered’: Arthur
            indicates that he is not going to dispute the legal basis of the knights’ quarrel with
            Guyon, but rather ask ‘pardon’ for him on essentially compassionate grounds. At the same
            time there is a play on the word ‘chalenge’, because medieval trials of right usually
            took the form of ordeal, including combat. In a chivalric encounter of this kind, a
            ‘challenge’ is a summoning or defiance offered by one contestant to others. Hence the
            ‘chalenge’ here might also be ‘an offer of battle, a defiance’, linked to the ‘matter of
            right’ being contested between the brothers and Guyon; cf. ‘debate’ as combat at 11.9
            and 54.6. (On the concentration of legal diction in this episode see Zurcher
            2007:70).

        7.5-6 See i.33.6n and ‘Introduction’ 00 for the symbolic rather than realistic
            time-scheme of the narrative. The seven solar years mentioned in these lines correspond

            at the corresponding moment in Book I, Arthur tells Una and Redcrosse he has sought

        <p>St. 22 Since the seventeenth century this has been the most commented-upon stanza in the
            poem. William Austin (1637) and Sir Kenelm Digby (1643) have long been identified as the
            earliest glossators in this tradition, but recent work on Ben Jonson’s marginalia
            establish Jonson’s copy as the almost certain source of Digby’s elaborate
                <hi rend="italic">Observations on the 22. Stanza</hi>. Jonson identifies the circle as the human
            soul and the triangle as the body, with the <hi rend="italic">quadrate</hi> fixed between them
            signifying the principal humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile). He also
            identifies the numbers seven and nine with the ‘Planetes and the Angells which ar[e]
            distributed into a Hierarch[y] which governe the body’ (Riddell and Stewart 1995, 107,
            175-76.)</p>
        <p> Specific verbal resemblances link this stanza to a discussion of the nature of the soul
            in Bryskett's <hi rend="italic">A Discourse of Civill Life</hi> (1606), a dialogue in which Spenser
            figures as a participant. Mills (1973) establishes the probability that the passage in
            Bryskett is an immediate source for this stanza, and demonstrates the explanatory power
            for understanding this language of the philosophical context toward which Bryskett
            points: the ‘mortalist controversy’ inspired by the dispute between Aquinas and the
            Muslim scholar Ibn Rushd (known in Europe as Averroes) over the relationship among the
            vegetative, sensitive, and rational souls and the <hi rend="italic">mens</hi>, or contemplative
            soul.</p>
        <p> The tradition that assigns occult symbolism to numbers and geometrical forms derives
            from Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> and was elaborated in the early 5<sup xmlns="">th</sup> century by
            Macrobius, who glosses seven, for example, as ‘the number by which man is conceived,
            developed in the womb, is born, lives and is sustained’ (<hi rend="italic">The Dream of Scipio
            </hi>I.vi.62-82; trans. Stahl 112). For further discussion of the intellectual traditions
            behind this stanza and of the critical tradition it has generated, see Fowler (1964),
            Mills (1973), Hamilton (2001: 238-39) and D. L. Miller (2006: 148-150).</p>

        22.4-5 The gendering of the body as feminine and the soul as masculine is a commonplace
            of Western literature and philosophy, deeply imbedded in Christian and Platonic

        <p>St. 5-68 Stanzas 5-68.2 contain Spenser’s chronicle of British kings from Brute to Uther
            Pendragon. Mills (1976) points out that, like the human body, the account of British and
            Faery dynasties is ‘Proportioned equally by seven and nine’ (ix.22.7). <hi rend="italic">Briton
                moniments</hi> is summarized in 63 nine-line stanzas that list 62 kings (Arthur will
            be the 63<sup xmlns="">rd</sup>), while the <hi rend="italic">Antiquitee </hi>of <hi rend="italic">Faery</hi> Lond (70-76) takes
            up seven stanzas, or 63 lines. Hamilton 2001 adds that 63 is the number of the ‘grand
            climacteric’, a notion that goes back to Greek astrology, mathematics, and
            philosophy.</p>
        <p>Occurring every seven years in life, climacterics were thought to be turning points. The
            ‘grand climacteric’ (usually the ninth) was seen an especially dangerous moment of
            crisis. Spenser’s time-scheme, which identifies Arthur allegorically with the advent of
            Elizabeth, thus implies that both reigns are historically fraught. Since his history is
            punctuated by lapses of the royal line when monarchs died childless (36.1, 54.1, 61.8),
            the allegorical advent of Elizabeth/Arthur may be fraught in part because the succession
            is disrupted.</p>

        St. 36 On the lapse of Brutus’s lineage see Harper (1910): ‘Here Spenser has made two
            additions to Geoffrey’s narrative: the first, that the line of Brutus ended with Ferrex
            and Porrex, and the second, that the progeny of Brutus ruled 700 years. The first
            statement has ample authority in Holinshed and Stow. The second seems to be based on the
            figures in the <hi rend="italic">Polychronicon</hi>, quoted by Holinshed, according to which the
            accession of Dunwallo was 703 years after the arrival of Brutus. Spenser may have
            identified the accession of the new line with the end of the old, and so have spoken of
            the 700 years that the line of Brutus reigned. But, while both additions to Geoffrey’s
            story may thus be accounted for by Holinshed, Spenser’s expansion of this part of his
            story and his emotional treatment of it, in strong contrast with Warner’s brevity,
            suggest an influence from the lament of Eubulus in the <hi rend="italic">Tragedy of Gorboduc</hi>. To
            this lament Spenser’s lines bear a decided resemblance’ (91).

        50.8-9 Geoffrey records that ‘Kymbelinus . . . was so fond of the Romans that he freely
            paid them tribute’ (80), which was later refused by his son Guiderius. Holinshed too
            records that ‘Kymbeline . . . lived in quiet with the Romans’, adding that he does not
            know which British ruler refused tribute (1965: 1.479). As Harper 1910 notes, Spenser
            appears to have followed Harison in transferring ‘the story of Guiderius to Kimbeline’

        <p>St. 8 Spenser draws in a broad way on classical and medieval pictorial traditions that
            associate sins and senses with specific animals, as well as on natural histories and
            bestiaries that retail proverbial lore about the special attributes of different animal
            kinds. The bestiaries, because they amass references from widely diverse sources,
            provide a store of anecdotes, judgments, and observations at once copious, random, and
            contradictory enough to justify almost any associative link. An additional layer of
            complexity arises from the allegorical emphasis on animal shapes as ‘portraying’
            temptations (11.7); because this technique tends to translate all five senses into
            visual terms, it cuts against the system of classification that disposes the
            allegory.</p>
        <p> A troop of animal-headed monstrosities appearing in Ariosto (see st. 5n) is taken by
            Harrington to represent the seven deadly sins (80). Spenser’s rablement is associated
            rather with the senses, which in st. 8-13 follow the traditional sequence based on

        22.8-9 Maleger’s helmet-skull confirms the suggestion running throughout the description

            two episodes: to cope with Furor, Guyon needs the Palmer’s aid to solve the riddle of
            uncontrolled strength that turns to weakness. This motif begins with Mortdant and Amavia

            literary landmark, this stone links Arthur to Turnus at the moment when the doomed
            hero’s strength is leaving him. Virgil in turn is recalling two distinct moments from
            the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>—one in which Diomedes wounds Aeneas (5.302-4) and a second in which
            Aeneas prepares to hurl a boulder at Achilles (20.283-87)—and is combining these with
            the famous dream-simile from the scene of Hector’s defeat (22.199-201). One effect of
            this complex allusive network is to link Arthur at this moment to heroes on the brink of
            defeat. Another is to linka him to a series of reversals: Aeneas as the target of a
            stone; then Aeneas hoisting a stone to throw it at Achilles; then Aeneas as the target
            once again, with Turnus taking his place hoisting as he re-experiences Hector’s sense of
            dreamlike unreality in flight from Achilles. This series of reversals echoes hints
            throughout this canto that link Arthur to Maleger, and suggests that on closer
            examination, the epic ‘land-marke’ will indeed become a ‘signe of sundry way’.

        <p>The chief literary model for Guyon’s voyage is found in Homer, <hi rend="italic">Od</hi> 12. Spenser
            cites Ulysses in <hi rend="italic">FQ</hi> Letter as Homer’s exemplary ‘vertuous man’, a conventional
            assessment that accords with Natale Conti’s interpretation of Ulysses in
                <hi rend="italic">Mythologiae</hi> 9 as the rational soul embattled on the one hand by emotions like
            fear, anger, or grief, and on the other by sensual pleasures (814-15). Harvey offers a
            similar assessment when he mentions his plan to read Leicester ‘suche a Lecture in
            Homers Odysses, and Virgil’s Æneads’ before his Lordship’s travel abroad that he will
            need no further instruction (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5.162-70). Other antecedents for Guyon’s
            voyage include Virgil, <hi rend="italic">Aen</hi> 2-3, and medieval accounts of the voyage of St Brendan
            (e.g. in <hi rend="italic">Legenda Aurea</hi>; see Var. 2.448-49). The most immediate antecedents are
            Tasso, <hi rend="italic">GL</hi> 15 and Richard Eden’s 1555 translation of Peter Martyr’s
            <hi rend="italic">Decades</hi>, one of the earliest and most widely circulated accounts of new world
            exploration.</p>
        <p> Read (2000) notes that ‘there are times when perils of the kind described in the
                <hi rend="italic">Decades</hi> offer more immediate and vivid models than could be found in
            Spenser’s traditional sources’ (96), but the modeling at work in Spenser’s use of
            exploration narratives is far more indirect than in Tasso. In <hi rend="italic">GL </hi>Carlo and Ubaldo
            travel through clearly identified Mediterranean and Atlantic topographies, and their
            voyage includes an explicit prophecy of the Christianization of the heathen New World,
            complete with an apostrophe to Christopher Columbus. Guyon and the Palmer, by contrast,
            encounter literary rather than geospatial landmarks, in keeping with the redefinition of
            ‘place’ introduced in the proem to Book II, where voyages of exploration are introduced
            as a trope for reading. Guyon’s voyage with the Palmer develops the trope in some
            detail.</p>

            light from water, flung back by the sun or the moon’s glittering form, flits far and
            wide’; 8.22-24). Ariosto picks up this image to describe Orlando’s distracted mood just
            before he abandons the siege at Paris to go in search of Angelica: <hi rend="italic">qual d'acqua
                chiara il tremolante lume, / dal sol percossa o da’ notturni rai, / per gli ampli

            and low, to right and left it fans out’; <hi rend="italic">OF </hi>8.71, trans. Waldman). Spenser at
            first appears to be moving the image back toward its more serene initial context, but
            the intervening traces of mental disquiet reappear in the immediately following
            lines.

        <mentioned>rift</mentioned>: The use of ‘rift’ to signify a projecting edge rather
            than a fissure is unusual, but characteristic of Spenser. Compare the rhyme-word
                <hi rend="italic">clift</hi>, which is Spenser’s preferred form of ‘cliff’ even though it is also a
            variant form of ‘cleft’. For the pairing of these terms, see e.g. Eden, ‘The ryftes and
            clyftes’ (1555: 134), or Holinshed (1965:1:217), in a passage Spenser remembers at
            III.iii.8-9, describing a ‘rift or clift’ near the shore of ‘a little rockie Ile in Aber
            Barrie’. Compare also the ‘ragged breaches’ hanging down at II.vii.28.3.

            that leads to decay), but as the monsters and water-hazards proliferate there is also a

            Spenser’s Bower condenses two Homeric sites, the island of Circe (<hi rend="italic">Od</hi> 10) and the
            garden of Alcinous (7.112-32), combining these with the history of the corresponding
            topoi, the enchanted isle and the <hi rend="italic">locus amoenus</hi>. Cf. the islands of Ariosto’s

                <hi rend="italic">Var</hi> 2.443-44). These literary places are at once similar and opposed to the
            biblical garden celebrated in the Song of Solomon: ‘My sister my spouse is as a garden
            inclosed, as a spring shut up, and a fountain sealed up’ (4.12). Spenser plays on this
            topos with a light touch in <hi rend="italic">Am</hi>, apostrophizing his beloved’s bosom as ‘the bowre
            of blisse, the paradice of pleasure’ into which his thoughts have, like Guyon in st.
            63-69, been ‘too rashly led astray’ (76.3, 6).

        42.3-4 These lines define the Bower as a ‘choyce’ locus of art, and hence a ‘place’ in
            the textual and rhetorical as well as the spatial sense (see ix.1.9n). As a topos, it
            has been singled out by the most skillful mimetic artists living. Cf. the description of
            Phædria’s island in canto vi as ‘a chosen plott . . . As if it had by Natures cunning
            hand, / Bene choycely picked out from all the rest’ (12.1-4). The recollection of this
            motif now, with the destruction of the Bower impending, evokes Gen 13:11, ‘Then Lot
            chose unto him all the plaine of Jorden’, especially in conjunction with the preceding
            verse: ‘So when Lot lifted up his eyes, he saw that all the plaine of Jorden was watered

            a decent life. Other writers thought that Medea was a criminal and an indecently

            Acrasia, and Busirane. Interestingly, Conti remarks that to some writers, ‘Medea
            represented Art, the sister of Circe or Nature; for Art tries its best to imitate
            Nature, and the closer it gets, the better art it's supposed to be’ (<hi rend="italic">Myth</hi> 489).
            For Spenser’s introduction of this motif as a keynote of Book II, see the notes to the
            proem, st. 4 and 5.

            from Conti (<hi rend="italic">Myth</hi> 243-245), but the ‘celestiall powre’ contrasted with the Genius
            of the Bower also has much in common with Conti’s Mercury (361-71), who in turn is
            associated with the Palmer (see 41.3-8n). According to Conti, Mercury was in charge of
            re-embodying ‘souls who had completed their stay in the Elysian fields’ (368), and was
            identified with ‘God's will . . . insofar as it brings things to life or sends them off
            to burial or the underworld’, and ‘with that divine power implanted by the gods in men’s
            minds, the power that wonderfully puts all our human activities in perspective and keeps
            them from falling apart. And since the ancients thought that this power is the source of
            our dreams, they said that Mercury was in charge of dreams’ (371). Elsewhere Conti does
            use the phrase ‘celestial power’ to describe Genius (901). He derives the name ‘Genius’
            from L <hi rend="italic">gignendo</hi>, ‘bringing forth’ (244). (For a more extensive canvassing of
            sources for Genius in both his guises, see <hi rend="italic">Var</hi> 2.375-76.)

        47.8-9 Spenser is one of the earliest writers in English to use the word <hi rend="italic">self</hi> as a
            substantive rather than a pronoun or adjective (see <hi rend="italic">Am</hi> 45.3, ‘in my selfe, my

            often personified by medieval writers) are faculties rather than entities. Spenser
            follows Conti in treating the self as a spirit distinct from the person it supervises,
            and consequently stresses the paradoxical way in which the Genius-self is non-identical
            with the ‘we’ whose self it is, who can ‘perceive’ its indwelling presence but cannot
            ‘see’ it directly. Spenser differs from Conti in treating this spirit as a generic or
            collective presence, ‘our Selfe’, inhabiting the individual (‘him selfe’).

        <p>70.9 The Bower’s all-inclusive harmony combines vocal and instrumental music with sounds
            of apparently natural origin; see st. 59n on the <hi rend="italic">paragone</hi> of Art and Nature, here
            seemingly reconciled. Appearances may be deceptive, however: in the episode from Tasso
            that Spenser is tracking closely in these stanzas, we are told that <hi rend="italic">L’auro, no
                ch’altro, è de la maga efetto</hi> (‘the breeze itself, not to speak of the rest, is
            made by the sorceress’; <hi rend="italic">GL </hi>16.10.5); see below, 72.1-2: 'There, whence that
            Musick seemed heard to bee, / Was the faire Witch herselfe’. The stanza in Tasso that
            stands behind Spenser’s 70.8-71 is 16.12, but in Tasso there are no voices and
            instruments. </p>
        <p> Spenser seems to combine Tasso’s stanza with two later descriptions of the enchanted
            forest that do mix human and natural music (18.18, 24). Those illusions are explicitly
            demonic, however, whereas the wind’s harmonizing in this stanza is ambiguous (<hi rend="italic">caso od
                arte</hi>, ‘chance or art’). Tasso’s <hi rend="italic">a prova</hi> (‘in contest’) does imply
            competition, but his birds are competing with each other, not with Art. Contrast
            vi.24-25, where Phædria joins in the song of the birds, but ‘would oftentimes . . .
            strive to passe . . . Their native musicke by her skillful art’ (25.2-4). The presence
            of art in the harmonics described by Tasso at 16.12 is not explicit, but is implied in
            the formal patterning of the interchange of birds and breezes.</p>

        St. 71 The elaborate patterning of this stanza, inspired by the interchange of birds and

            observes: ‘an Imitation of Tasso, but with finer Turns of the Verse: which are so

        St. 73 The description in this stanza derives from Lucretius by way of Tasso. Its
            Lucretian origins connect the stanza with the love of Mars and Venus invoked repeatedly
            in Spenser (see I.pr.3.7-9 and note). Lucretius begins <hi rend="italic">De Rerum</hi> with an
            invocation to Venus that includes a prayer for peace, which she can grant because Mars
            succumbs to her charms (1.33-40). Tasso echoes the Lucretian invocation in his
            description of Rinaldo alseep in Armida’s lap (GL 16.18.7-19). In translating Tasso with
            the phrase ‘her soft breast’, Fairfax will chasten the Latin <hi rend="italic">gremium</hi> and Italian
                <hi rend="italic">gremio</hi>, which can mean either lap or breast, whereas Spenser (at 76.9) will
            prefer the more sexually suggestive ‘lap’.

        73.3-4 In Lucretius, Mars feeds his eyes on Venus. Tasso gives the metaphor a paradoxical
            turn as Rinaldo consumes himself while feeding his gaze on Armida. Fairfax slightly
            softens this paradox. Spenser by contrast sharpens the paradox while shifting it from
            Verdant to Acrasia ‘seeking medicine, whence she was stong’. At the same time, Spenser
            detaches the paradox from the trope of feeding, which he also shifts to Acrasia, giving
            it a decidedly predatory rather than self-destructive turn: Latin <hi rend="italic">pascit</hi> and
            Italian <hi rend="italic">pascendo</hi> give way to the animalistic and more violent <hi rend="italic">depasturing</hi>,
            which means not just feeding on but utterly consuming. At this point the reversal (and
            transvaluation) of Lucretius is complete, having proceeded by way of an intertextual
            troping that enacts the figure of hypallage or exchange, nicknamed by Puttenham ‘the
            Changeling’ (see 45.3-4 and note).

        73.6-7 Upton proposed that the ‘lips’ and ‘eyes’ in these lines were transposed in
            printing, and that the correct reading would have Acrasia sucking the knight’s soul out
            through his parted lips (<hi rend="italic">Var</hi> 2. 387-88). Alternatively, the transposition of lips
            and eyes may simply extend the work of hypallage described in the preceding note.
            Lucretius describes Mars’s breath hanging upon Venus’s lips, an image that almost
            suspends the act of respiration in the luxuriance of the kiss. Tasso imagines Rinaldo
            sighing, with the transfer of his soul into Armida represented as a simile or
            impression. Spenser literalizes the transmigration of the warrior’s soul while
            transferring the action to Acrasia: not his sighing but her sucking carries his soul
            into her.

        St. 74-75 This <hi rend="italic">carpe diem</hi> lay, a counterpart to Phaedria’s siren song at vi.15-17,
            is based on Tasso, <hi rend="italic">GL</hi> 16.14-15. Tasso’s singer is a male parrot. Fairfax changes
            the bird’s sex; he also chastens the flower’s <hi rend="italic">nudo . . . sen</hi> (‘naked breast’) to
            the less vivid ‘beauties’. Spenser leaves the singer unspecified, but captures the sense
            of <hi rend="italic">sen</hi> with ‘bared bosome’. His translation is so close, and so inspired, that it
            must have set a daunting precedent for Fairfax (see the exchange on this subject between
            Hazlitt and Lamb, <hi rend="italic">Var</hi> 2.289). Spenser’s striking innovation is the closing phrase
            ‘equall crime’, which makes the pleasure more salacious than in Tasso, since the
            consciousness of sinning seems to constitute a distinct pleasure in its own right (cf.
            ‘pleasant sin’, 77.2.)

            its creation, encoded in the phrase ‘poured forth with plentifull dispence’ at 42.8 and
            would complete the physical allegory of male arousal begun in st. 1 (see st.1n and

        St. 85-87 Acrasia’s prototype in turning men to beasts is Homer’s Circe (<hi rend="italic">Od</hi> 10),
            but as Hamilton 2001 notes, it is Conti and not Homer who suggests that the men’s animal
            shapes reflect the passions that dominate their minds (<hi rend="italic">Myth </hi>476). In Homer,
            Circe’s victims retain human intelligence, transformed in body only. Whitney (1586),
            following Conti, reports that Circe’s menagerie prefer to retain their animal forms:
            ‘when they might have had their former shape againe, / They did refuse, and rather
            wish’d, still brutishe to remaine’ (82). In Spenser, the ‘sad end . . . of life
            intemperate’ (85.6) is evidently reversible, but both this end and its reversal seem
            provisional; Spenser neither follows Homer nor hews to the Conti-Whitney revision, but
            splits the difference between them.
