            Faeryland without a bloodhound (II.pr.4). Its approximation to the related form

        <p>[This spear] was made by Bladud, a British king, skilled in magick; see B.iii.C.3.St.60.
            . . . The staff of this Speare was of ebony, see B.iv.C.6.St.6. and it was headed with
            gold: ‘una lanza dorata’, as Boyardo, in Orl. Innam. calls it. . . . But let us hear the
            history of it from the Italian poets. —Galafron King of Cathaia, and father of the
            beautiful Angelica, and of the renowmed warriour Argalia, procured for his son, by the
            help of a magician, a lance of gold, whose virtue was such, that it unhorsed every
            knight as soon as touched with its point. Berni Orl. Innam. L.i.C.1.St.43. . . . . After
            the death of Argalia, this lance came to Astolpho, the English duke
            [Orl.Inn.L.i.C.2.St.20.] with this lance he unhorses his adversaries in the tilts and
            tourneyments [Ibid. Canto iii.] Just as Britomart overthrows the knights with her
            enchanted spear, in B.iv.C.4.St.46. In Ariosto, Orl.Furios. . . . we read of this same
            inchanted lance. Again C.xviii.St.118 . . . Astolfo, in C.xxiii.St.15. gives this
            inchanted speare of gold to Bradamante . . . With this speare Bradamante gains a lodging
            in Sir Tristans castle, ‘la Rocca di Tristano’, Canto xxxii. (St.65.) Not unlike to
            Britomartis, who gains her entrance, when refused a lodging, B.iii.C.9.St.12. (1987:
            625-26)</p>
        <p>Upton also suggests the spear of Athena (<hi rend="italic">Il</hi> 5.746) as the model for this enchanted
            spear, but Homer does not specify any enchantments, observing only that with her spear
            ‘heavy and huge and strong’ the goddess ‘vanquishes the ranks of men’ (τῷ δάμνησι στίχας

        8.7-9 See ii.18-21 for this part of the story. The anticipatory summary here emphasizes
            the parallel between Britomart’s quest and Arthur’s, hers for an image seen in a mirror,
            his for a vision beheld in a dream. Unlike the Prince, Britomart will find her partner
            in the narrative. On ‘<hi rend="italic">Venus</hi> looking glas’, see pr.5.5-9, where the queen is asked
            to see herself ‘fashioned’ in ‘mirrours more than one’. That Britomart sees a future

            espousal of her unmarried state is one reason Arthur cannot find Gloriana.

        Arthur’s assuaging ‘reason’ differs comically from the Palmer’s proverbs, appeasing Guyon

        See I.ix.1 and note. Encounters among the protagonists of the various legends, or between
            any of them and Arthur, typically issue in pledges of faith seen as links in the ‘golden
            chaine of concord’. Accordingly, this stanza is linked to Arthur’s rescue of Redcrosse
            in Book I, Guyon’s reconcilement with Redcrosse (II.i.34.1-2), Arthur’s rescue of Guyon
            (II.viii.55-56), and, still to come, the mutual aid rendered by Britomart and Redcrosse
            (i.28-30, 66.7-9; iv.4.4-5). The pattern is varied in Book III: in the first two legends
            Arthur arrives in canto viii as an allegory of divine grace, delivering first Redcrosse
            and then Guyon from certain death. In Book III he is present instead for the first-canto
            reconciliation, and his subsequent course runs parallel to Britomart’s rather than
            supervening upon it. Instead it is Britomart who renders aid, initially to Redcrosse and
            eventually to Scudamour.

            with calculation of advantage, Ariosto’s irony is apparent. Spenser has separated the
            two moments (for the flight of Angelica, see st. 15-18) and, by doing so, muted the
            irony. But insofar as his golden chain of concord is still partly knit by the artful
            soothing of Guyon’s wounded pride (11.4-9n), Spenser is not so much ignoring Ariosto’s

            Elizabeth’s relations with her favorites (see 26.3n, and cf. 32.4, st. 33-44).

        33.5-9 The implied criticism of the Castle’s ‘stately manner’ is carefully poised between
            a judgment that such extravagance constitutes ‘superfluous riotize’ (excessive,
            dissolute living; cf. the ‘lawlesse riotise’ of Idleness in procession of the Seven
            Deadly Sins at the House of Pride, I.iv.20.5) under any circumstances, and a more
            circumspect reflection that it is inappropriate for ‘the state of meane degree’. The
            closing question—how is it possible to support such a style of magnificence?—is left
            hanging with respect to an authentically royal court like that of Elizabeth, neither
            applied directly nor emphatically deflected.

        34.4-5 The subject of these tapestries, like that of most others in the Renaissance,

            ‘Lament for Adonis’—so that the poet’s imitation of an imagined depiction is implicitly
            reclaiming the narrative for poetry while passing it through a fictional transposition
            into pictorial art. If the fictional tapestry’s principal sources are Ovid and Bion,
            Spenser’s is probably Conti (<hi rend="italic">Myth</hi> 5.16; 437-441) or C. Stephanus s.v. ‘Adonis’
            and ‘Adonis horti’, which provide most of the details in Spenser’s account.

        St. 35-38 The passage moves gradually from description to narration, substituting its own
            ‘speaking picture’ (Sidney, <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi>: 80) for the one it is describing as the
            tapestry fades from view and the story comes forward. (See II.xii.45.3-4n on the
            equivalent effect in the description of the gate to the Bower of Bliss.) ‘Then’ at 35.1
            follows from ‘First did it shew’ (34.7), preserving the reference to the tapestry but
            doing so in elision; ‘Now’ (at 35.4 and 35.6) sustains the elision while making the
            temporal reference more immediate. Stanzas 36 and 37 move into direct narration, without
            reference to the pictorial artifact; by the time st. 38 resumes the rhetoric of deixis
            (pointing at), it is no longer clear whether ‘Lo, where beyond he lyeth languishing’
            asks us to witness the narrative event or its pictorial representation.

        36.1-4 These lines, echoing the description of Acrasia as she leans over the sleeping
            Verdant in the Bower of Bliss (II.xii.73), extend the suggestion in earlier passages
            that the Legend of Chastity takes up and revises issues imperfectly resolved in the
            Legend of Temperance (see notes to III.pr and to arg.3, 1.9, 7.8, 9.8, 11.2). Britomart
            defeats Guyon’s lingering irascibility in an episode that harks back to the opening of
            Book II, then revisits the Book’s final episode as an initial rather than terminal test
            of her virtue. It is perhaps not too much to say that the Castle Joyeous ‘is’ the Bower
            of Bliss, experienced now as Britomart’s nemesis rather than Guyon’s. (So for example
            the image of maternal eroticism in the tapestries appears less predatory, and conveys
            more empathy for Venus’s desire, than corresponding moments in the Bower.)

        38.4-5 ‘Endlesse’ and ‘evermore’ gesture toward one of the commonplace themes of the

            movement is not so much stilled as dilated into a perpetually unconsoled tenderness.
            Milton will capture both the tenderness and the perpetuity of this gesture when he

        <p>Spenser bases the Lady’s mistaken lust for Britomart on Ariosto’s Fiordispina, who falls
            hopelessly in love with Britomart’s prototype Bradamante (<hi rend="italic">OF</hi> 25.29-70). The
            comedy of Ariosto’s episode (based on the Ovidian tale of Iphis and Isis, <hi rend="italic">Met</hi>
            9.666-797) is tempered with sympathy for Fiordispina, who has better luck than Malecasta
            in that Bradamante turns out to have a twin brother, much like Viola in Shakespeare’s
                <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi>. Ariosto shows that Fiordispina’s passion for
            Bradamante/Ricciardetto is no less powerful for having its basis in illusion and its
            satisfaction in a bed-trick; Spenser turns this comedy of ‘falsed fancy’ the other way,
            implying that the Lady’s consuming passion for Britomart would be no less self-deceptive
            were the knight as ‘fresh and lusty’ as she imagines ‘him’ to be.</p>

        <p>St. 58-60 </p>
        <p>As Britomart slips into bed and Malecasta rises to steal anxiously toward her ‘bowre’
            (60.2), Spenser at once recalls and transforms the scene from <hi rend="italic">OF</hi> in which
            Ruggiero awaits the approach of Alcina (7.21-26). As Dodge shrewdly notes, ‘the
            situation is . . . the exact reverse’: the drama of sexual anticipation is displaced
            from the male knight in his chamber to the Lady of the castle in her approach (and the
            outcome will be quite different) (1897: 183). This allusion suggests in yet another way
            that the Castle Joyeous is a revisionary take on the Bower of Bliss, for the ‘vele of
            silke and silver thin’ worn by Acrasia at II.xii.77.4 alludes to the <hi rend="italic">vel suttile</hi>
            that Alcina wears to her rendezvous with Ruggiero. The intertextual link points up the
            comic reversal not only of the scene from Ariosto, but also of that from the Bower:
            Britomart is no Ruggiero, nor is she about to become another Verdant. The comic reversal
            of outcome in this noctural scene is coded into the pun on the phrase ‘in armes’ that
            characterizes Noctante (see 45.7n), as Britomart veers abruptly from one sense of the
            phrase to the other.</p>

        65.7-9 Cf. Homer, <hi rend="italic">Il</hi> 4.139-40: ἀκρότατον δ’ ἄρ’ ὀϊστὸς ἐπέγραψε χρόα φωτός· /

            the outermost flesh of the warrior, and immediately dark blood flowed from the wound’).
            Spenser’s very different context both reinforces and repudiates the suggestion (absent
            in Homer) of a sexual defloration. The imagined loss of virginity is doubly deflected—it
            was never a literal possibility in the first place, and the ‘dart’ all but misses its
            target. Britomart does, however, suffer a ‘flesh wound’ (echoing that of Adonis at
            38.5-6, though less serious)—perhaps because she was taken in by Malecasta’s histrionic
            anguish (st. 53-54), or because <hi rend="italic">Gardante</hi> alludes to the love-wound inflicted on
            her by the ‘image shee had seene in <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi> looking glas’ (8.9). The two
            possibilities are related insofar as it is precisely her experience of the love-wound
            that renders her susceptible to pity for Malecasta.

            Britomart with the internal ‘stowre’ precipitated by her desire for Artegall. Her
            reaction to anything that threatens to stir this inner tempest is combative: she would
            rather be pierced and ‘die’ in battle than in bed.

        20.2-9 The story of Phao (from Gk Φαος light) is Spenser’s invention, perhaps based in
            part on Pharos, the lighthouse constructed at Alexandria by Ptolemy II. The fable of the
            glass tower (Phao’s ‘bowre’) engages the theme of voyeurism introduced in the Bower of
            Bliss episode, suggesting that voyeuristic desire is based on a fantasy that combines
            perfect invisibility with panoptical power. The fragility of this fantasy is suggested
            both by the vulnerability of the tower’s maker, betrayed by his ‘leman’, and by the
            vulnerability of the supposedly ‘impregnable’ tower itself, shattered with a single
            blow.

        <p>The military purpose of Merlin’s glass extends Spenser’s sustained treatment of
            Britomart’s erotic volatility as a switchpoint between concupisciple and irascible
            impulses—between fantasies of being sexually ‘in armes’ and a defensive reaction of
            taking up arms (see st. 6 notes). As Hamilton notes, Britomart sees Arthegall in the
            mirror because ‘he invades her kingdom’.</p>

        27.1-2 Britomart is literally ‘crestfallen’. The crest as a symbol of knighthood is

            stont upright / A crest in token of a knight’. Cf. also 25.1 on Artegall’s crest, the

            ‘As it represents the ornament worn on the knight’s helmet, it cannot properly be borne

            entails a corresponding discovery of her own gender, which she experiences as a sudden
            loss of virility. That all this should unfold because of an image she has seen in her
            father’s closet while looking in his mirror (st. 22) further implies that the imaginary
            ‘masculinity’ lost in this moment has been based in an identification with her father:
            ‘nothing he from her reserv’d apart’ (22.3), but she has now discovered that he does
            ‘reserve a part’—namely the object that separates <hi rend="italic">he</hi> from <hi rend="italic">her</hi>—and that she

        <p>St. 30-51 </p>
        <p>This episode is closely modeled on a passage from the anonymous late-classical
                epyllion<hi rend="italic"> Ciris</hi>, attributed to Virgil in medieval and early modern editions.
                <hi rend="italic">Ciris </hi>tells the story of Scylla’s treasonous passion for King Minos, who has
            laid siege to her father’s city. Merlin’s mirror, given to King Ryence ‘That never foes
            his kingdome might invade’ (21.3), serves a function analogous to that of King Nisus’s
            charmed crimson lock of hair: ‘As long as this preserved its nature . . . Nisus’ country
            and kingdom would be secure’ (123-25). The aligning of Artegall with Minos implicit in
            this analogy extends the pattern representing Britomart’s erotic experience as a form of
            combat (see notes to st. 6 and 21). Spenser’s major revision is to undo the Latin text’s
            substitution of Scylla for Britomartis (daughter of Scylla’s nurse, Carme, and Jupiter),
            who fled from Minos rather than toward him, and was rescued by Diana. In lamenting
            Scylla’s dangerous passion, Carme addresses the princess as her <hi rend="italic">alumna</hi>
            (‘foster-child’, line 224; 33.6), and apostrophizing Minos, asks why he is destroying
            her foster-child as he once before destroyed her daughter (286-96). Spenser’s Britomart
            fuses the two daughter-figures as she embodies a fight-or-flight ambivalence toward her
            erotic object. (See Hughes 1929: 348-54; Roche 1964: 53-6.)</p>

            In the background of the phrase ‘loathed nest’ is the proverb ‘It is a foul bird that
            defiles its own nest’ (Tilley 1950, B377), which hints at the feeling that a formerly
            protected space of childhood innocence has been violated—and at the uneasy sense that
            Britomart herself is the source of the violation. The echo of i.58.6-7 may reinforce
            this sense: at Castle Joyeous, Britomart made very sure that all the other guests were
            gone before she ‘gan her selfe despoile, / And safe committ to her soft fethered nest’.
            These bed-scenes are linked as well by intense ‘unrest’, although the tossing and
            turning passes from Malecasta in canto i to Britomart in canto ii; and by sudden
            starting out of bed, although it was Malecasta who startled Britomart in canto i and
            Britomart who frightens herself in canto ii. These associations retroactively suggest
            further reasons for Britomart to identify with Malecasta: her own chastity seems to
            arise as a defense against disturbing intimations of unchastity from within herself.

            ‘nought’, which means ‘nothing’ but also ‘promiscuity or indecency’. For other instances
            of Spenser’s play on the senses of this word, see the notes to II.i.33.4-5, ix.32.5, and
            ix.42.4. The narrator’s assurance that King Ryence ‘nothing . . . from her reserv’d
            apart’ (22.3) continues to unfold its resonance (see 27.1-2n). Insofar as Britomart’s
            discovery of both her desire and her sexual identity has altered her sense of the
            ‘nothing’ withheld from her, Glauce’s double negative suggests that the ‘knot’ of desire
            keeping the maid awake at night arises precisely from her ‘nought’.

        49.5-9 Glauce’s recipe combines ingredients from Virgil and Ovid with local English
            herbs. Maplet identifies rue as ‘the Medicinable Herbe: and especially there where as
            excessive heate is found’; savine as a remedy for ‘all griefs in the inward partes and
            bowels’; calamint (mint) as a cure for swellings, and dill as a ‘hindrance to issue’
            (1567: 60v, 61r, 52r, 40r). According to Burton, <hi rend="italic">Anatomy</hi> 3.2.5.1, camphora
            counteracts lust. Dido’s priestess in Virgil, <hi rend="italic">Aen</hi> 4.515-16, uses colt wood to
            treat her mistress’s passion for Aeneas, while Ovid’s Medea uses milk and blood to seek

        <p>In these stanzas Spenser plays with a distinction from the rhetorical tradition between
            factual and fictional descriptions. Thus Peacham (1577), for example, distinguishes
            between <hi rend="italic">Topographia</hi>, ‘an evident and true description of a place’ (P1), and
                <hi rend="italic">Topothesia</hi>, ‘a fayned description of a place, that is, when we describe a

        <mentioned>cruell Feendes</mentioned>: Merlin is associated in medieval romance with
            diabolical spirits, one of whom supposedly fathered him (cf. 13.1-5). So in Malory, for
            example, one knight warns another, ‘Beware . . . of Merlion, for he knowith all thinges
            by the devylles craffte’ (<hi rend="italic">Morte</hi> 3.18-19). Spenser mentions Merlin’s ‘sprights’ at
            7.9, and they figure prominently in the legend of his demise (st. 10-12). In Ariosto,
            Bradamante’s offspring appear explicitly as a procession of such spirits (see arg.n).
            Spenser, by contrast, isolates his references to sprights and demons within stanzas
            7-13, where they are rhetorically ‘flagged’ as popular superstition. When Britomart and
            Glauce arrive on the scene in st. 14, Merlin appears to be alone; and although he seems
            at one point in the genealogy to point at a spectacle (‘Behold the man’, 32.1), the
            absence of other signals implies that this is rather a moment of heightened rhetorical
            vividness than a reference to anything literally visible in the cave. (So too at 21.5
            Merlin, beginning to speak after a brief silence, is said to ‘foorth display’ ‘his
            spirite’.) Ariosto’s explicitly demonic procession reflects a tradition in Virgilian
            commentary that rationalizes Aeneas’s descent to the underworld as the product of demons
            and witchcraft (Wilson-Okamura 2010: 157-63).

        <p>Cf. the description of Fidelia’s power ‘when she list poure out her larger spright’ at
            I.x.20. Like the subtle distancing of Merlin from his medieval reputation as half-demon,
            the strong resemblance between st. 12 and that earlier account casts Merlin as an agent
            of divine providence. Through such indirect means Spenser hints at a conversion
            narrative similar to the story of Merlin’s birth as given (for example) in the Old
            French <hi rend="italic">Merlin</hi>, where the magician is sired upon a young nun by a demon acting as
            an incubus. The council of devils intends for this parody of the Annunciation to produce
            an antichrist, but Merlin is sanctified in the womb by his mother’s prayers and
            repentance, and after birth by the sacrament of baptism. Spenser’s Merlin remains a more
            ambiguous figure, claiming to speak for providence without having entirely severed his
            connection to diabolical origins—related, not coincidentally, in st. 13 immediately
            following the description that links him to Fidelia.</p>

        14.8-9 See 7.1 and 6.3n for ‘straunge’; Merlin’s ‘characters’ are stranger for the
            wrenching of accent that places metrical stress on the second syllable. Merlin’s writing
            in the earth sustains the calculated ambivalence with which Spenser presents him, for it
            echoes both godly and diabolical precedents. At John 8:6, 8, Jesus writes on the ground
            with his finger when challenging the scribes and Pharisees who accuse the woman taken in
            adultery; in Tasso’s <hi rend="italic">GL</hi> 13.5-11, the Saracen magician Ismen ‘formed his circle
            and traced his symbols’ (<hi rend="italic">suo cerchio formovvi e i segni impresse</hi>; 5.9) to summon
            ‘spirits innumerable, infinite’ (<hi rend="italic">innnumerabili, infiniti / spiriti</hi>; 10.1-2) to
            enchant the forest that supplies the armies of Godfrey with timber for the siege of
            Sion. The description of Merlin also echoes that of Archimago calling up ‘Legions of
            Sprights’ at I.i.36-38; this echo is reinforced by the link both passages share to
            Tasso’s Ismen, whose ‘dread syllables’ which ‘the tongue that is not irreligious cannot
            repeat’ (<hi rend="italic">orribil note, / lingua, s’empia non è, ridir no pote;</hi> 8.8-9) are closely

            her gestation of Ruddymane as having taken up ‘thrise three’ lunar months; at

            dedicated to ‘The most mightie and magnificent Empresse Elizabeth’.

        <p>These stanzas present the second of three installments into which Spenser divides the
            British chronicles. He begins in II.x with what is chronologically the second part,
            covering the reigns of British monarchs from the mythic eponymous founder Brut to the
            succession of Uther Pendragon, the father Arthur does not know (see notes to II.x.arg.1,
            st. 5-68, and 68.2-3). The second part now resumes with the reign of Artegall and
            Britomart, which has no direct source in the chronicles but occupies the genealogical
            space from which Arthur, wandering in Faeryland, has been displaced. The gap between
            Arthur and Artegall-Britomart is the space in which the poem’s ‘present’—a hybrid of
            Faery fiction and British chronicle history—unfolds (see st. 29n). The third part of the
            chronicles, circling back to link the origins of British history to the westward
            ‘translation of empire’ from Troy through Rome to England, is given in canto ix.</p>

        <p>Artegall’s royal heir remains unnamed, in part no doubt to downplay his equivalence to
            the chronicles’ Conanus, who came to the throne by killing his uncle. (Spenser thus
            reverses the chronicle acccounts, which identify no father for Conanus.) Spenser may
            also have chosen not to name the heir because he represents the point at which faery
            fiction is grafted onto the chronicles. The resulting genealogy, never spelled out, is
            complex. It may be summarized as follows: the Lady Igrayne (Igerne) bears sons both to
            Gorlois and to Uther. To Gorlois she bears the brothers Artegall and Cador; to Uther,
            their half-brother Arthur. Arthur succeeds Uther to the throne but dies without heir.
            The chronicles report that Arthur is succeeded by Constantius (Constantine), the son of
            his half-brother Cador. Meanwhile, however, Spenser has created an alternative genealogy
            whereby Artegall (‘equal to Arthur’; see ii.arg.2n) and Britomart not only succeed King
            Ryence to the throne of South Wales (cf. ii.18.5n) but also take the place of Ryence’s
            brother-in-law, Arthur, in the succession of British rule. This silent and, as it were,
            figurative supplanting of Arthur is re-enacted explicitly when their son merges with the
            historical Conan to usurp the crown from his uncle Constantius, who succeeds Arthur to
            the throne in the chronicles.</p>

        <mentioned>his ymage dead</mentioned>: The phrase also suggests ‘his dead image’ and
            ‘the image of him in death’, and echoes Glauce’s question to Britomart about the first
            effect Artegall’s image has on her: what has ‘living made thee dead’ (ii.30.9)? This
            compressed and ambiguous phrasing is found in two other places in Spenser, both
            suggesting that the poem itself will function as heir to (image of) the childless
            Elizabeth (v.54.9, <hi rend="italic">Am</hi> 33.4). On the structural necessity for patriliny to make
            sons into spectral likenesses of their fathers, see D. Miller (2000, 2003). Insofar as
            Artegall’s heir corresponds not only to Conan but also to the juncture where Spenser
            splices his fiction into the chronicles, it may be said that the nameless child figures
            the poem’s mirroring function with respect to Elizabeth and the monarchical succession
            she embodies.

            into Wales, laying waste to churches, towns, and fields along the way, corresponds to
            Geoffrey except in one detail, for Geoffrey refers to ‘Gormundus’ as ‘the king of the
            Africans’ (<hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> 256); Spenser’s reference to his <hi rend="italic">Norveyses</hi> follows

        <p>On Spenser’s use of Ariosto, see the notes to ii.1 and 2. As Hamilton observes, ‘this
            stanza is structured on the elegiac <hi rend="italic">ubi sunt</hi> [L where are] topos’. The phrase
            appears in the opening lines or the refrain of medieval Latin works, usually lamenting
            the brevity of mortal things. Spenser’s focus is different: women’s glory hasn’t faded
            because of the general mutability of things. The elegiac associations of the language
            serve rather to set off the sexual politics that take the place of mutability in causing
            the disappearance to be lamented, even as they also anticipate the sorrowful tone that
            will prevail in the canto. At the same time, the narrator’s seeming innocence about
            where all the warlike women have gone, compared to the knowing criticism of masculine
            bias voiced in the opening of canto ii above, contributes to a wry undertone that
            qualifies this prevailing sorrow with an amused irony.</p>

        <p>Britomart’s refusal to remove her armor is introduced at i.42.7; when she does remove it
            on going to bed (i.58.6), the consequences are distressing. Here the mention of her
            unwillingness is not clearly motivated, and so the reader is left to muse upon the
            relation between Britomart’s keeping to ‘her former course’, her refusal to doff her
            arms, and her pensiveness as she ‘fashions’ a mental image of Artegall in response to
            the Redcrosse knight’s rhetorical ‘display’ of his appearance. (For the importance of
            rhetorical display in the account of Merlin’s prophecy, see the notes to iii.8.9, and
            32.1.) </p>
        <p>The language of this stanza is dense with terms used by Spenser to describe his own
            activity as a poet; in its emphasis on the idealizing force of Britomart’s fantasy, the
            description of her mental activity parallels Sidney’s definition in the <hi rend="italic">Defence of
                Poetry</hi> of ‘right’ poets, ‘who having no law but wit, bestow that in colours upon
            you which is fittest for the eye to see’ (80). The description of Britomart’s mental
            activity in this stanza also harks back to the gestation simile (ii.11) that describes
            her first response to the image ‘displayed’ by Redcrosse.</p>

        6.1-5 The catachresis of feeding a wound extends the paradox intimated by the spelling

            since she is already wounded—is doubly futile inasmuch as her thoughts are not only

        28.6-9 Contrast iii.25.9 (and note), where Merlin’s confidence that heavenly causes will

            Cymoent’s reliance on Proteus offers a close analogy to Glauce’s reliance on Merlin: at
            stake in both situations is the interpretation of a wound, which can be understood only
            by locating it within the right narrative context. In each instance the predestined
            outcome (‘terme’ as end-point) depends on the hazards of interpretation (‘terme’ as the

            The combination of hyperbolically weeping rocks with this aestheticizing of lament may
            distance Cymoent’s grief. The nymphs’ musical ‘complement’ may also echo the ‘most
            melodious sound’ heard by Guyon and the Palmer (II.xii.70.1) as they approach Acrasia
            and Verdant—another ironic pietá, expressing self-indulgent sexuality rather than, as

        <p><a xmlns="" name="39"/>The third and final complaint in this canto’s series (see st. 8-10n). All
            three evoke amused sympathy as they balance pathos against various qualifying ironies,
            underlined by the parallels among them. Spenser’s account of Night in these stanzas is
            based principally on Conti, <hi rend="italic">Myth</hi>. 3.12, which in turn gathers references from
            Euripedes, Cicero, and Hesiod. Arthur’s hostile address to ‘hasty Night’ (54.9)
            specifically echoes that of Chaucer’s Troilus, who also blames night for its haste
            (3.1427-42). For the praise of sleep, see Sidney, <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> 39, ‘Come sleep, oh sleep,
            the certain knot of peace’. Both the longing for rest and the need to resist that
            longing are deeply rooted in Spenser’s sense of life as moral struggle: see especially
            the seductive rhetoric of Despair (‘sleepe after toyle, port after stormie seas’;
            I.ix.40.8).</p>

        2.7-9 The driving force of love is conveyed by the accelerating repetition of the verb

            of Desmond and his brother, Sir John of Desmond, killed his attackers. The earl of
            Desmond and his brother were later killed as part of the New English suppression of
            their Munster-wide revolt. In the ensuing division and plantation of Desmond’s vast
            estates, Spenser secured the grant of Kilcolman castle and a ‘seignory’ of about 3,000
            acres.</p>

        20.7 The thigh-wound associates Timias with Ovid’s Adonis, slain by the boar he was
            hunting: <hi rend="italic">tuta petentem / trux aper insequitur totosque sub inguine dentes / abdidit
                et fulva moribundum stravit harena</hi> (‘deep in the groin [the fierce boar] sank
            his long tusks, and stretched the dying boy upon the yellow sand’;<hi rend="italic"> Met</hi>
            10.714-16). Timias, like Adonis, is a hunter whose prey has turned upon him. The wound
            to the groin or thigh is allegorically sexual, and thus tends to identify the hunter
            with his predator/prey; the implication is that Timias partakes of the lustful nature of
            his opponents. See Robertson’s discussion of the thigh-wound suffered by Launcelot in
            Chretien’s <hi rend="italic">Chevalier de la charrete</hi> (1961: 450-51), quoting St. Jerome on the use
            of ‘thigh’ as a genital euphemism.

        35.5 A recurrent motif in Spenser, the surmise of divinity is taken from Homer by way of
            Virgil (see II.iii.33n). In context, it contrasts with the surmise of bestiality hinted

        <p>Spenser reverses the situation in Ariosto, where it is Angelica rather than the wounded
            youth who suffers (see st. 27-54n). The contrast between Timias’s two wounds
            participates in a sustained and complex exploration in Book III of the conventional
            metaphor that characterizes love as a wound. This exploration begins with the tapestry
            image of Adonis ‘Deadly engored of a great wilde Bore’ (i.38.2); it continues in
            Britomart’s wounding by Gardante, in the subsequent account of her wounding by ‘the
            false Archer’ when she sees Artegall in her father’s mirror, and in the wound she
            inflicts on Marinell.</p>

            specific to wounds of becoming infected and swelling with pus; it grows ‘whole’, or
            healthy, but also ‘hole’, opening rather than closing up. The opening/closing wound

        <mentioned>soverain mercy</mentioned>: Appearing for the third time in this episode,
            the word ‘sovereign’ accumulates resonance from Belphoebe’s allegorical link to
            Elizabeth I. Spenser says in <hi rend="italic">FQ </hi>Letter 35-37 that the queen’s royal person is
            represented by Gloriana, whereas her private personage as ‘a most vertuous and
            beautifull Lady . . . in some places I do expresse in Belphœbe, fashioning her name
            after your own excellent conceipt of Cynthia, (Phœbe and Cynthia being both names of
            Diana.)’ He recurs to Ralegh’s poetic ‘worship’ of Elizabeth as a goddess in stanzas 3-5
            of the proem to Book III (see notes). Spenser is careful to use ‘sovereign’ in this
            episode in its generalized sense of ‘preeminent’, but the insistent trace of royal
            status in this word points to the terms of the dilemma Timias shares with Ralegh: the
            queen’s ‘two persons’ cannot really be separated, and so the erotic devotion she is said
            to inspire in her private capacity as a beautiful woman must be restrained by the awe
            due to her royal majesty. Timias (again, like Ralegh) enacts the relation between the
            queen’s two bodies in a histrionics of desire at once ‘constraynd’ and proscribed.

            garden’; <hi rend="italic">OF</hi> 19.33.1-4).</p>
        <p>The decorum of this stanza is at once risky and delicate, since Spenser as poet is
            venturing into the ‘secret store’ (50.9) where neither Ralegh nor Timias dares to tread
            (see pr.3.9n, pr.5.6-9n, and cf. II.iii.26.9n, II.iii.27.7-9n). The phrase ‘daughter of
            her Morne’ evokes Belphoebe’s youth but does so in a catachrestic figure that represents
            her virginity as precisely that which it prevents, offspring. The phrase ‘More deare
            than life’ reinforces this suggestion, implying that Belphoebe cherishes her own
            intactness more than Timias’s survival or the need to propagate. ‘The girlond of her
            honor did adorne’ implies a sense of display that runs counter to the privacy of ‘secret
            store’ (50.9), and the following lines play out these implications as the weather
            changes and Belphoebe allows her rose to spread its petals and ‘florish fayre’. </p>
        <p>This doubleness runs through the diction of the lines as well: ‘lapped up’ means
            ‘wrapped’ or ‘folded’, but ‘lap’ is also a common early modern term for the genitals;
            ‘chayre’ describes how the petals are ‘lapped’ (dearly, from Fr <hi rend="italic">cher</hi>), but also
            says what they are (Fr <hi rend="italic">chaire</hi> flesh). In this diction and imagery the tensions
            surrounding the royal body natural are wrought to a fine pitch: at one extreme, the
            trope of catachresis respects the inexpressibility of the royal genitals, while at the
            other extreme the mimetic likeness of the opening rose to that which must not be named
            is no less unmistakable.</p>

        <p>The mythmaking in this stanza sustains the precarious ambiguities of st. 51. God and
            Paradise evoke the memory of Gen 1:28, ‘Bring forthe frute and multiplie, and fil the

        <p>The birth of Chrysogonee’s twins is embedded in a digression based on Moschus’s pastoral
            idyll ‘The Fugitive Love’. In the gloss to <hi rend="italic">SC March </hi>79, E.K. mentions this poem
            as having been translated into Latin by Poliziano and into English by Spenser. Tasso in

            poem, and Spenser now elaborates its incipient narrative still more fully. </p>
        <p>In the process he continues to use the romance convention of interweaving storylines to
            create a sliding movement of displacement: thus the consummation denied Timias is
            attained in a different key and setting by Titan’s bright beams; Venus searching for
            Cupid (Amor) will find Amoret; and the sequence
            wounding-courtship-consummation-impregnation-parturition will lead to a garden where
            ‘the fruitfull seades / Of all things living’ (8.3-4) play out their life-cycle in the

        <mentioned>Disguiz’d in thousand shapes</mentioned>: One of many hints that love is
            conceived of as a force of metamorphosis: as Cupid takes many shapes, so the force he
            represents transforms those on whom it acts. In this sense, the presence of Ovid in Book
            III is not merely episodic but pervasive, and not only thematic but also formal. The
            sliding movement of displacement (see st. 11-26 note) that characterizes the
            entrelacement of storylines suggests that metamorphosis has also become so closely
            identified with poesis that the narrative itself assumes the characteristic Ovidian
            tension between identity and change of shape. (See the discussion of the gate leading
            into the Bower of Bliss in the introduction to Book II, and Barkan 1986: 242.)

        14.6-9 Cf. v.1-2, where the narrator declares that Cupid ‘shewes his powre in variable
            kindes’ (1.3) according to the character of a lover’s mind. By this logic, the
            ‘reproches rife’ of the city-dwellers would apply reflexively to themselves. Hollander
            (1988:105-6) sees st. 13-15 as a ‘reflexive allegory’ that prepares for the second half
            of canto vi by showing that ‘Love’ will not be found in courtly amorous complaint, urban
            satire, or pastoral lament, but only in a mythopoeic allegory like that of the Garden of
            Adonis—where Cupid will indeed be found at the end of canto vi.

        <p>st. 29-50 </p>
        <p>See note to arg. 3. In the architecture of the 1590 poem, Spenser’s Garden of Adonis is
            poised in contrast to both the Bower of Bliss at II.xii and the House of Busyrane at
            III.xii; it has clear links as well to the story of Venus and Adonis portrayed in
            Malecasta’s tapestries (III.i.34-38). As part of an ongoing engagement with Ovid in Book
            III, Spenser’s description of the Garden elevates and transforms the concept of
            metamorphosis much as the visionary speech of Pythagoras does in the final book of
                <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> (esp. 15.176-258). For the influence of Virgil (<hi rend="italic">Aen</hi>
            6.724-51) and Virgilian commentaries in mediating the Platonic doctrine of reincarnation
            to the Renaissance, see Wilson-Okamura (2010: 178-87). </p>
        <p>In the critical tradition, this passage has provoked a series of either/or questions that
            it does not resolve: Is the Garden singular or plural? Does it exist inside or outside
            of the sublunary world? Are its most important philosophical debts to Plato and
            Neoplatonism or to Epicurus and Lucretian materialism? Does the grim reaper Time,
            described in stanzas 39-40, operate inside or outside of the Garden? Is the ‘wide wombe
            of the world’, said in st. 36 to contain ‘An huge eternal <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi>’, located inside
            or outside of the Garden? The persistence of such questions suggests that the signature
            trope for the Garden may well be amphibole (see 4.2n): the language of the Garden is
            itself generative. </p>
        <p>The Garden is said to be ‘the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> seminary / Of all things’ (30.4-5, emphasis
            added), but is bounded by ‘two walls’ with ‘double gates’, attended by a porter ‘the
            which a double nature has’ (st. 31), and characterized by ‘continuall Spring, and
            harvest there / Continuall, both meeting at one tyme’ (42.1-2). The implication is that
            the origin and continuity of the created universe depend upon a primordial coupling of
            opposites, including matter and form, life and death, nature and art. This coupling is
            figured by heterosexual copulation, although sexuality in the Garden is not specifically
            human but rather polymorphous and coextensive with the material world of <hi rend="italic">natura
                naturans</hi> (nature as process).</p>

        <mentioned>Paradize</mentioned>: The association of classical gardens with Eden is
            suggested (for example) in Justus Lipsius’s praise of gardens: ‘Looke into the holie
            Scripture, and you shall see that gardens had their beginnings with the world, God
            himself appointing the first man his habitation therein, as the seate of a blessed and

            . . .’ (<hi rend="italic">Two bookes of constancie</hi>, trans. Stradling 1595: 61). This association
            was bolstered by the belief that the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">adon</hi> lord was etymologically linked
            to <hi rend="italic">eden</hi> pleasure.

        <p><mentioned>The Gardin of Adonis</mentioned>: See arg.3n. Socrates in Plato’s
                <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> (276b) compares the writing down of ideas—as opposed to developing
            them through dialogue—to the planting of seeds in a small ‘forcing’ garden, i.e. one
            that uses artificial means to hasten the maturity of seedlings. Erasmus, citing Plato,
            Plutarch, and Theocritus, gives the proverb ‘more fruitless than gardens of Adonis’
                (<hi rend="italic">Adages</hi> 1.1.14). Spenser retains the association with fertility but not the
            disparaging tone of these references, perhaps following Conti, who reports that
            Athenians in ancient times ‘used to sow wheat and barley in fields near the city, and
            they called those places (that were sown with fruit-bearing trees) the Gardens of
            Adonis. Theocritus, in his discussion of the Adonia celebrants [participants in the
            rites sacred to Adonis], recalls those fruits that they offered to Adonis: “For there’s
            not a fruit the orchard bears but is here for his hand to take” (15.112)’ (<hi rend="italic">Myth</hi>
            439). </p>

        <p>The combination of doubling and ambiguity in these lines lends itself to many construals.
            Comparison to the double gates of Alma’s house (II.ix.23 and 32) suggests that the
            Garden may reverse the bodily processes of ingestion, digestion, and excretion. The
            ‘Doubly disparted’ gate through which the knights enter Alma’s castle is framed ‘of more
            worthy substance’, and is the way ‘by which all in did pass’; through the contrasting
            ‘backgate’, excrement is ‘avoided quite, and throwne out privily’. The Garden, by
            contrast, has ‘double gates’ through which ‘both in and out men moten pas; / Th’one
            faire and fresh, the other old and dride’. This ambiguous syntax either breaks down the
            distinction between Alma’s entrance and exit or reverses the analogy, yielding a golden
            wall with a gate through which fair and fresh ‘men’ exit, and an iron wall with a gate
            through which old and dried ‘men’ enter.</p>

        <p>st. 36 </p>
        <p>Spenser’s account of Chaos fuses classical with scriptural precedents. The most important
            classical description of Chaos is that of Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Met</hi> 1.5-20. Arthur Golding, in
            the Epistle to his 1567 translation, proposes that Ovid’s account is based on scripture
            (342-49). In 1596, Spenser will locate Chaos ‘Downe in the bottome of the deepe
                <hi rend="italic">Abysse</hi>’ (IV.ii.47.6), echoing the Vulgate’s translation of Gen 1:2, <hi rend="italic">Terra
                autem erat inanis et vacua, et tenebrae erant super faciem abyssi</hi> (‘And the
            earth was without forme and voyde, and darknes was upon the depe’). </p>
        <p>Spenser’s stanza echoes classical arguments that the sum total of matter in the created
            universe never changes (Lucretius, <hi rend="italic">De rerum natura</hi> 1.215-64; Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Met</hi>
            15.251-58), but it does so in support of the hexameral argument that new matter is
            produced out of Chaos. This matter has been identified with Augustine’s <hi rend="italic">prima
                materia</hi>, although the plural ‘substaunces’<hi rend="italic"> </hi>might seem rather to imply the
            Lucretian idea that each species possesses a kind of matter proper to itself (see
            30.1-6n and 35.5-7n). </p>
        <p>This may in turn suggest that Spenser identifies Chaos not only with the abyss out of
            which God created the universe, but also with the state into which matter returns when
            it loses its form in death. So in <hi rend="italic">Rome </hi>307-8, ‘The seedes, of which all things at
            first were bred, / Shall in great Chaos wombe againe be hid’. On this reading Chaos
            would be ‘inside’ the Garden insofar it refigures the transition elsewhere associated
            with the return through ‘the hinder Gate’ (32.9; see notes to st. 31-33).</p>

        <p>st. 39-40</p>
        <p>As W. Hyman observes of st. 39, ‘The first thing this description of time should recall
            to the reader is Guyon’s own handiwork in the Bower’ (2007: 212).</p>
        <p>Since Time as the grim reaper Saturn is an enemy only to individual creatures, not to the
            ‘shapes’ or species-forms that are ‘bred’ in the Garden (35.1), the suggestion that Time
            may be cutting down ‘all . . . That in the <hi rend="italic">Gardin of Adonis</hi> springs’ <hi rend="italic">while it
                is still growing in the Garden</hi> has proven confusing to readers and commentators.
            If, however, ‘it’ in 39.1 refers to the lilly of 38.9, then ‘all the rest’ must
            designate the host of embodied creatures who take their origin from the Garden but live
            and die in the world. At the same time, the ‘mowing’ of these creatures may be viewed
            either as passage out of the world or as re-entry into the Garden. In this sense the
            process lamented in these stanzas as destruction corresponds to that described from the
            opposite perspective at 33.1-4: ‘After that they againe retourned beene, / They in that
            Gardin planted bee agayne; / And grow afresh, as they had never seene / Fleshly
            corruption, nor mortall payne’. See 40.6n; for a similar doubling of perspectives, see
            II.xii.1.4n and the discussion of <hi rend="italic">fomes peccati</hi> in the introduction to Book II
            (p. 000). Spenser’s description of the Garden repeatedly telescopes opposed perspectives
            into a single phrase or image (see st. 48n); in this sense the locus is always both
            singular and plural at the same time (see arg.3n)</p>

        <p>This description of gratification untroubled by hostility, jealousy, or censure suggests
            that the Garden is a locus of sexuality viewed as a natural function rather than as a
            human experience fraught with emotional complexity, regulated by social custom, law, and
            religious or ethical principles. This does not mean human sexuality is excluded from the

            where the terms ‘Paramor’ and ‘leman’ initially suggest human sexual partners, but then
            give way to ‘Each bird his mate’ without distinguishing whether the phrases are offered

            address to Jesus or Mary. ‘Franckly’, together with the biblical ‘knowes’, balances the
            naturalistic, intimate, and devotional connotations while disarming the moral or
            juridical; compare ‘wanton Pryme’ (42.4), where the moral connotations of wantonness
            dissolve when the term is applied to the season of springtime. This effect contrasts
            pointedly with the description of the Bower of Bliss, where the landscape comes alive

            celestial influence is not excluded—see 34.3-6, where things grow as they were created
            because they ‘remember’ the divine command—but such influence is a vital force within
            earthly things as they live and die, like the ‘eternall moisture’ of 34.9. The
            difference between ‘heavenly’ and ‘heavy’ (one looking up, the other down) is at play
            throughout the stanza. The boughs of line 3 extend the ‘bothness’ of simultaneous spring
            and harvest by bearing blossoms to deck the springtime even as they ‘labour’ with the
            autumn harvest. They ‘clyme’ the trees in the sense of surmounting them in rising ranks
                (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>); the heaviness of the trees anticipates that of the ‘fruites lode’ in

        Adonis: Last seen in the tapestry of Malecasta, i.34-38, where his transformation first
            into a flower and then into a woven image suggests a kind of rebirth (see 29.8n). Here
            his preservation is asserted more powerfully, as Venus continues to ‘enjoy’ his ‘joyous
            company’ in a sexual embrace that restates with peculiar intimacy the meeting of spring
            and harvest ‘at one tyme’ (42.2), as her reaping of pleasure coincides with the

        <p>47.8-9 Cf. 9.1-2, ‘Great father he [the sun] of generation / Is rightly cald, th’authour
            of life and light’. Adonis becomes ‘the Father of all formes’ specifically in copulating
            with Venus. On heterosexual coupling as an imaginative solution to the philosophical
            problem of how forms can be joined with matter—unresolvable within the terms of Platonic
            metaphysics—see Teskey (1994 and 1996). The ‘copula’ Spenser here envisions is at once
            sexual (although it reverses Plato’s vertical positioning of the partners within the
            coupling) and grammatical: unless forms can be embodied in matter, it becomes impossible
            to predicate the existence of things.</p>
        <p> Hamilton follows Lewis (1966) in proposing that Spenser identifies Adonis with matter
            and Venus with form, but Spenser’s Adonis may be better explained by the Epicurean
            notion that different kinds of matter contain ‘seeds’ (<hi rend="italic">primordia</hi> or
            <hi rend="italic">semina</hi>) out of which forms grow. Forms come and go as creatures live and die, but
            Lucretius argues that the principle of continuity that enables natural forms to recur
            must inhere within matter, since otherwise anything could arise from anything else,
            whereas we see in nature that oaks grow only from acorns, and acorns grow only from
            oaks. Spenser’s Adonis is ‘lapped’ within the anamorphic pudendum of the Garden like a
            Lucretian seed-principle harbored within matter: not separable from matter, but
            certainly not coextensive with it, especially when matter is thought of, contra
            Lucretius, as <hi rend="italic">opposed</hi> to form.</p>

        <p>In line 4, ‘cloyd’ means both ‘pierced’ and ‘surfeited’, and as such offers an exemplary
            moment in this stanza’s doubling of its cast, insinuating an identity between the boar
            that gores Adonis and the lover who satiates him. The logic of this identification would
            seem to be that of 42.1-2 (see note), with spring and harvest, or birth and death, ‘both
            meeting at one tyme’, or of 46.5, where ‘flowres and pretious spycery’ lap Adonis in
            connotations at once of blossoming and of embalming. This doubling of Venus and the boar
            is reinforced by the fact that the wounding of Adonis was proverbially genital;
            Golding’s Ovid goes so far as to specify ‘his codds’ as the location of the wound
            (10.839). </p>
        <p>These doublings, difficult to hold in mind, are at once complicated and reenforced by the
            parallel between Venus and Adonis in the Garden and the wounding of Timias in the
            preceding canto. There, Belphoebe pursues a wounded beast whose trail leads her to
            Timias, implying the possibility of a supplementary identification between the wounded
            boy and the boar. She then heals his thigh-wound (as Venus preserves Adonis), but in
            doing so wounds his heart (as if reviving the role of boar, or Foster-with-boarspear, on
            another level). Similarly, the language of the present stanza not only hints at an
            identification of the Venus who preserves Adonis with the boar that wounds him, but also
            suggests a supplementary analogy between Adonis ‘lapped’ in her genital arbor and the
            boar ‘emprisoned’ in her cave: in the logic of the allegory, it is precisely <hi rend="italic">by</hi>
            harboring Adonis ‘from the skill / Of <hi rend="italic">Stygian</hi> Gods’ (46.6-7), perpetually
            enclosed within Nature’s vagina, that she can shut the boar away from him ‘for ay’.</p>

        50.7-9 As the fugitive Cupid sought in the first half of the canto is found at last in
            the Garden, so too is the pleasure missing from Chrysogonee's miraculous conception of
            Amoret and Belphoebe (see 27.1-3n). Cf. Apuleius, <hi rend="italic">Met</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Sic rite Psyche
                convenit in manum Cupidinis et nascitur illis maturo partu filia, quam Voluptatem

            of a childe, whom we call Pleasure’; 6.24). Since the erotic ‘sporting’ and ‘playing’ in
            Venus’s mount is not limited to reproductive sex (see 49.3-4n), the allegorical
            personification of Pleasure takes on a playful twist in Spenser’s text, the figurative
            equivalent of a pun in which the two distinct purposes of sexual activity, pleasure and
            reproduction, coincide. As yet another in the canto’s series of amphiboles (see 4.2n),
            this may imply either that sexual pleasure should be coextensive with reproduction or
            that pleasure itself is the proper fruit of sex. A very different reading is suggested
            by Boccaccio’s interpretation of the fable (<hi rend="italic">Genealogia</hi> 5.22) as an allegory of
            the soul’s union with divine love to produce eternal joy. Given the emphasis throughout
            canto vi on the material basis of natural reproduction, Spenser would seem to be
            bringing this spiritual allegory back down to earth.

        <p>The passion of the witch’s son for Florimell in this episode is analogous (in a comic
            vein) to that of Timias for Belphoebe in canto v. These two episodes, flanking the
            purely naturalistic description of sexuality in the Garden of Adonis (see vi.41n), place
            erotic desire in a distinctly human and social context, emphasizing disparities of rank
            as if they were differences of kind like the species-forms in the Garden. They also
            bracket the paradisal freedom of utterance in the Garden (see vi.43.7-9n) with matched
            episodes in which a lover of inferior station is unable ‘to utter his desire’ (16.4).
            This challenge is one the poet himself confronts initially in the proem and recurrently
            throughout Book III: how to find a language adequate to the perils of speaking as a male
            about the sexual or psychological interior of a noble woman (see pr.5.6-9n). Britomart
            finds her own desire for Artegall unspeakable, both in her initial confession to Glauce
            and again when she enters Merlin’s cave; his prophecy in canto iii develops one response
            to the challenge, as it lends both voice and legitimacy to Britomart’s desire by
            installing it within a dynastic narrative.</p>

        17.3-6 Caroling birds and garlands in the poem have by now a history of association with
            courtship and erotic desire, beginning with the entry into the ‘wandring wood’ at

            Duessa (I.vii.3.4-5 and 4.2-5). Here these darker connotations are muted by the surprise
            that love has instilled aesthetic impulses in the supposedly ‘beastly’ churl. The
            association in this episode of the Churl, the caroling birds, and the themes of bondage
            and constrained utterance may suggest a link to Lydgate’s fifteenth-century beast-fable,

        17.6-9 The image of squirrels in bondage shows a surprisingly literary bent in the Churl,

            to ‘young birds’, the ‘resemblaunce’ of Churl to squirrel participates in the episode’s
            motif of miniaturization: in contrast to the ‘ravenous beast’ of Florimell’s fearful
            imagination (1.2) and its pending embodiment in the Hyena-like beast (st. 22), the
            Churl’s beastliness is rendered small, cute, and harmless, as if Florimell has wandered
            briefly into a Disney animated feature. At the same time, these lines participate in the
            episode’s sustained send up of the poet-lover. The effect is at once complex and
            delicate, for the Churl remains an object of ridicule even as he accrues sympathy;
            meanwhile some of the ridicule bends back toward Ralegh and even Spenser himself,
            insofar as the Churl offers a ‘resemblaunce’ to their respective courtships of

        <p>The appearance of the witch’s beast marks a sharp turn away from the comic tone of the
            episode, almost as if the blow suffered by the witch and her son with the loss of ‘their
            fayre guest’ (19.8) turns them from hapless admirers of divine beauty back into evil
            monsters, or as if Florimell’s fear triggers the emergence of the beast. Both
            impressions may be accurate: Florimell leaves ‘For feare of mischiefe, which she did
            forecast’ (18.4), but it is not clear from the previous description of their behavior
            that she should fear either of her hosts. The beast’s appearance, seeming to confirm her

        22.8-9 The ‘Hyena of Lust’, as the beast is conventionally nicknamed, is not really a

            equivocation identifying it as less a hyena than a hyena-similitude. The textual
            genealogy of this chimerical beast is mixed: it owes something to the Orc in Boiardo
                (<hi rend="italic">OI </hi>3.3; see Blanchard in <hi rend="italic">Var</hi> 3.263); something to medieval
            bestiaries, which link hyenas to changeableness, hypocrisy, and sin; something to the
            hyena of <hi rend="italic">Ecclus</hi> 13:18, identified by the Geneva glossators as ‘a wilde beast that
            counterfaiteth the voyce of men, and so entiseth them out of their houses and devoureth
            them’; and something to the epistles of Peter, which gloss not only his spots (see
            22.5n) but also his diet: ‘For all flesh is as grasse, and all the glorie of man is as
            the flower of grasse’ (1 Pet 1:24). Spenser’s lines at once literalize the concept of
            lust as a carnal ‘appetite’ and suggest, by way of the Biblical echo, that flesh is not
            a spiritually nourishing diet, for as 1 Pet goes on to say, ‘The grasse withereth, and
            the flower falleth away. But the worde of the Lord endureth for ever’ (1:24-25). On the

            esp. 475-76, describing her flight. In Ovid this story leads into that of Venus and her
            mortal lover Adonis, who is the offspring of this incestuous union (cf. I.i.9.6n and
                <hi rend="italic">Met</hi> 10.489-524, esp. 524, describing Adonis’s beauty as avenging his mother’s
            passion). For Daphne’s flight from Apollo see Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Met </hi>1.525-552; Spenser has
            previously echoed this passage in connection with Florimell’s flight (see iv.46.4-5n).
            The combination of wickedness with fearful innocence in this double simile puts a number
            of ambiguities into play, as the repeated phrase ‘Not halfe . . . Nor halfe’ manages
            indirectly to suggest that Florimell is the sum of her counterparts. The reference to
            Myrrha, anticipating Florimell’s repulse of the aged fisherman’s lust, repeats the
                <hi rend="italic">hysteron proteron</hi> motif in which fear seems to summon its objects into
            existence; see st. 22n and viii.23.7, where Florimell addresses the fisherman as
            ‘father’.</p>

            <hi rend="italic">kestos</hi>) which the groom would loosen on the wedding-night. The loosening of the
            girdle in Homer is similarly a prelude to sexual intercourse when Poseidon,
            impersonating the river-god Enipeus, lies with Tyro: ‘And he loosed her maiden girdle,

            hand’ (<hi rend="italic">Od</hi> 11.246-47). Homer’s Venus wears a girdle that embodies her power of

            14.214-21). In Ovid, Ceres learns her daughter Persephone’s fate when the nymph Cyane

            the similitude may suggest that Sir Satyrane’s victory over the beast is less complete
            than it seems.

        36.1-4 On the girdle, see 31.8-9n; Satyrane’s use of it to bind the beast develops its

            that strives’ without success to ‘enclose’ the flood in the preceding simile (34.1-2),
            the girdle represents not a complete repression of desire but a channeling of it in

        <p>st. 37</p>
        <p>The Giantess bearing a captive squire reverses the image of Dis carrying away Persephone
            (see 31.8-9n), and seems to contrast with the beast as a figure of female rather than
            male lust. As such she and her victim travesty the maternal eroticism of Venus
            cherishing Adonis in the Garden. The episode qualifies any simple gendering of its
            contrasts, however: the beast was created by a female ‘maker’ (35.9) and is bound with
            an emblem of feminine chastity in marriage, while the ‘bold knight’ who pursues the
            Giantess (37.4; ‘He’ at 43.8), and who alone can threaten her, will be revealed as an
            armed virago on horseback, like Britomart. This reversal, akin to the moments when
            Britomart is mistaken for a male, may be echoed in the name ‘Argante’ (47.2) if it
            alludes to the male knight in <hi rend="italic">Argantes</hi> in Tasso.</p>

            plays with motifs of exaggeration and diminution (see 5.2n), the image of Satyrane
            plucked from his saddle by a giantess evokes a humorously literal incongruity of
            proportions: the knight who moments ago wielded a spear ‘in bignes like a mast’ (40.6)

        <p>This inset narrative is adapted from the Inkeeper’s tale in Ariosto <hi rend="italic">OF</hi> 28. An
            anecdote, perhaps apocryphal, holds that John Harington translated the tale and
            circulated it among the ladies in the royal court. Elizabeth is said to have ‘punished’
            him by barring him from the court until he had finished translating the rest of the poem
            (Park 1804, 1.10). When Harington published the completed translation in 1591, he took
            note of Spenser’s imitation: </p>
        <p>The hosts tale in the xx viij booke of this worke, is a bad one: M. <hi rend="italic">Spencers</hi> tale
            of the squire of Dames, in his excellent Poem of the Faery Queene, in the end of the
            vii. Canto of the third booke, is to the like effect, sharpe and well conceited; in
            substance thus, that his Squire of Dames could in three yeares travell, find but three
            women that denyed his lewed desire: of which three, one was a courtesan, that rejected
            him because he wanted coyne for her: the second a Nun, who refused him because he would
            not swear secreacie, the third a plain countrey Gentlewoman, that of good honest
            simplicitie denyed him. (373)</p>
        <p>Spenser’s imitation may allude to Harington’s escapade, but the anecdote serves even if
            apocryphal to illustrate the point of Spenser’s allegory, which calls attention to the
            circumstances of the tale’s telling and reception, and in this way reflects critically
            upon its circulation as a tale that is recurrently both disavowed <hi rend="italic">and</hi> retold.</p>

        5.3-6 A similar rivalry between art and nature is prominent in the Bower of Bliss, where
            the seductive powers of art are linked to the influence that ‘guilefull semblants’
            (II.xii.48.6) wield over the fantasy. The Bower thus offers an implicit genealogy for

        <p>st. 6</p>
        <p>Spenser’s description of the false Florimell’s creation implies a combination of alchemy
            and witchcraft: Mercury is a staple of alchemical processes, and the witch’s journey to
            a distant mountain-range famous for its snow recalls Medea’s nine-day journey to gather
            magical herbs on Ossa, Pelion, Othrys, Pindus, and Olympus (Ovid <hi rend="italic">Met</hi> 7.216-36).
            These arcane practices are fused in a parodic literalization of the Petrarchan
                <hi rend="italic">blazon</hi>, which inventories the physical beauties of a mistress by way of
            far-fetched similitudes. Compare Spenser’s handling of this convention in
                <hi rend="italic">Amoretti</hi> (e.g. 15, 17, and 21), where he acknowledges in the opening sonnet
            that his beloved ‘derived is’ from Helicon, the haunt of the Muses. The allegory of
            poetic invention implied in the creation of the false Florimell may be recognized by
            Ralegh, who imitates Spenser’s fiction (unless Spenser is imitating him; the dating of
            Ralegh’s poem is uncertain) in a lyric found in different forms in two early
            seventeenth-century manuscript miscellanies:</p>

            E.K. glosses ‘frowye’ (as he spells it) to mean ‘mustye or mossie’. 1609 alters ‘frowy’
            to ‘frory’ (frosty), which appears again at 35.2 when Proteus kisses Florimell with

        Phocas: Gk and L for ‘seal’. Thomas Cooper 1565 notes that Proteus is ‘the god of the

        43.4-5 See ii.29.9n. The emphasis on writing in the hearts of women echoes v.52.7, where
            God plants the flower of chastity ‘in gentle Ladies breste’, even as it is
            counterpointed by Florimell’s resistance to Proteus (‘So firmely she had sealed up her
            brest’, 39.5). This trope reaches back through the praise of Belphoebe and the
            sufferings of Britomart to the poet’s opening declaration in the proem to Book III that
            chastity ‘is shrined in my Soveraines brest’, where ladies ‘Neede but behold the
            pourtraict of her hart’ (1.5, 8). This pattern of echoes and repetitions implicates the
            poetic project of ‘fashioning’ chastity—in the sense both of representing its image and
            of inspiring readers to emulate that image—as perilously akin to the less idealized
            forms of erotic persuasion that play across the narratives of Book III.

        47.1-6 Cf. Cymoent’s too-hasty belief that Marinell has been slain (iv.36-40). The
            oxymoronic overtones of ‘surely doubt’ (emphatically dread) undercut the certainty the
            phrase nominally expresses.

        52.6-7 It may seem odd that the Squire of Dames first directs the knights to ‘yonder
            castle’ for shelter and then explains why they won’t find it there, but his emergence as
            a secondary narrator seems to be the main point. This role was flagged to the reader’s
            attention in the close of canto vii, where the Squire’s retailing of the Innkeeper’s
            tale from Ariosto precedes (and in some sense perhaps causes) the escape of the
            hyena-like beast that Satyrane had bound with Florimell’s girdle. As the narrative turns
            back to Satyrane and the Squire at the end of canto viii, Spenser’s narrator
            disapprovingly reminds us of the Squire’s ‘long discourse of his adventures vayne, / The
            which himselfe, than Ladies more defames’ (44.2-3); the reminder prepares us for the
            Squire’s resumption of his role as storyteller as it carries over, now, into canto
            ix.
