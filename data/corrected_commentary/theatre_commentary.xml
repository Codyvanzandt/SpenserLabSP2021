	<note target="#theatre_1316026447667662" type="commentary"><mentioned><span xmlns="" class="italics">THEATRE</span></mentioned>: Not an uncommon title for a sixteenth-century
   book meant to provide a critical conspectus on a subject. Such books share with theatrical
   auditoria the function of offering an object of scrutiny rendered circumscribed and made
   available for serious reflection to a spectator whose situation allows him or her an
   objectifying, but not dispassionate vantage.</note>

   set forth by the most noble and virtuous Lord, John van der Noot, patrician of Antwerp, by &#8220;M.
   Rabilae&#8221;, poet of Brabant.&#8217; &#8216;M. Rabilae&#8217; is probably an anagram of the name of Melchior van
   Baerle (Barlaeus), Antwerp author of a number of Latin poems on mythological subjects.</note>

    <mentioned>Haec . . . serenam</mentioned>: &#8216;Let Babylon read these things and learn to rear
    its earth-bound head as far as heaven: here is the sure path to life, which the noble example of
    van der Noot gives to men to read. Scorning his homeland, certain victories, and official
    rewards, aware that virtue has no foundation in blood, he has raised his mind to greater things
    and, by this work, lets the world know of his uncommon suffering and of his life's sad labors. </p>
	 <p> &#8216;Let Babylon read these things; let it read and fill its ears with this work. And if anyone's
    mind is shrouded in dark mists and, forgetful of the right path, wanders across trackless rocks,
    here, the mists removed, he may find out the Supreme Good. The teachings of the &#8216;Wise&#8217; disperse
    the truth and jumble it with empty falsehood. O senseless minds of men! Not that Church of the
    Gods but the alerted mind, lashing these Learned ones with a harsh rope, will lead the corrupted
    soul to better things. </p>
   <p> &#8216;O that the idols lay overthrown! May His honor, which moves all things, be restored. Yet
    sometimes a kinder fortune will drop from the stars and the piteous rulers of most high Olympus
    will behold our struggles, behold how the tyrants of all lands rage with furious mind. But
    whoever is inflamed to discover the star that points out the true path, read here these learned,
    late-night labors which learned van der Noot has wrought for you. Like the Ploughman who watches
    the clouds chased away by the sun and the fields renew their smiling, so will you see a tranquil
    light shine out, through the dense smoke, for you.&#8217; </p>

   furrowed and forehead always wrinkled? I see that you&#8217;re bothered by the publication of this
   book. But why, I wonder, should you find that troubling? Is it because it attacks the rites of
   the Papists and the worship of idols, and doesn&#8217;t lament despoiled Babylon? It doesn't mind some
   backbiting, Zoilus; it is content to have delighted the good and discomfited the wicked. &#8216;Goossens, steadfast.&#8217;</note>

 <note target="#theatre_1316026447670439" type="commentary"><mentioned><span xmlns="" class="italics">my departure oute of Brabante</span></mentioned>: Van der Noot fled Antwerp
   (in the duchy of Brabant) in the spring of 1567 after a failed Calvinist attempt to take control
   of the city government. Margaret of Parma had put down the revolt, yet she exercised what would come to
   seem, in hindsight, a comparatively moderate approach to this and prior Calvinist insurgencies in
   Antwerp and its environs; when the Duke of Alva replaced her later in the spring, a number of
   Antwerp&#8217;s Protestants sought refuge in England and Germany. More of the Dutch exiles ended up in
   London than in any other individual European locale.</note>

   on visual hygiene does more than prepare for the carefully disciplined visionary poems to come.
   The Antwerp Calvinists had a resolute interest in the purification of visual culture, having
   engaged in an aggressive program of iconoclasm in the years before the crackdown that forced van der Noot
   to flee to England. The identification of the Roman church or the pope with the Antichrist has a
   number of pre-Reformation antecedents, and figures in the first of the twenty-five articles of
   the Lollards (1388).</note>

 <note target="#theatre_1316026447671023" type="commentary"><mentioned><span xmlns="" class="italics">prince</span></mentioned>: Although van der Noot refers to Elizabeth as a
  &#8216;Princesse&#8217; in the dedicatory half-title, the sex-neutral use of the term &#8216;prince&#8217; was in wide
  use.</note>
	<note target="#theatre_1316026447671071" type="commentary"><mentioned><span xmlns="" class="italics">lineally descended</span></mentioned>: The assertion is polemical: after all,
   in 1536, her father, Henry VIII, had declared Elizabeth illegitimate; he reversed himself by the Act of
   Succession of 1543, which Act Edward VI had attempted to overrule in the Device for the
   Succession of 1553. There were several claimants at the time of the publication of <span xmlns="" class="italics">Theatre</span>. Henry Hastings still had a few supporters, and more important,
   the pretensions of Elizabeth&#8217;s second cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, had been explicit since the
   death of her half-sister, Mary Tudor, when Henry II of France declared his son, Francis II, and
   Mary, his wife, king and queen of England. Even though Mary Queen of Scots had fled to England
   from Scotland in 1568 and was very much under Elizabeth&#8217;s thumb when <span xmlns="" class="italics">Theatre</span> was published, her claims to the English throne had the abiding support of
   England&#8217;s Catholics: the publication precedes the Northern Rebellion by only a few months. Van
   der Noot&#8217;s affirmations of Elizabeth&#8217;s sovereignty here have a nervous truculence; they
   contribute to the general defense against Catholic claims to authority in <span xmlns="" class="italics">Theatre</span>.</note>

   as ancient and Early Modern musical theory emphasized the relation between mathematical

   between legal justice, administered in England on the authority of custom, maxim, and statute and
   equity, an extralegal power to bring legal justice, in specific cases, into line with the general
   principles from which it springs. Van der Noot&#8217;s readers would have associated equitable justice
   with particular (conciliar) courts, and above all the Chancery and the Court of Requests.</note>

   translation of the Bible to those committed to church reform, concerned as they were with lay
   access to scripture, van der Noot&#8217;s emphasis here falls on a different matter of linguistic
   access. He praises ways in which the religious needs of its various ethnic communities were

	<note target="#theatre_1316026447672788" type="commentary"><mentioned><span xmlns="" class="italics">Christian discipline</span></mentioned>: The Protestant reformers were
   concerned not only with the correction of doctrine and the reform of church polity, but with a
   reform of discipline, that is, of the methods of doctrinal and moral correction in pastoral
   practice, especially at the parish level. This orientation to discipline was especially pronounced in the work of

    2:22</mentioned> the distinguishing feature of the Antichrist is his denial of the divinity of Jesus.
   The identification of the Antichrist as a son or descendant of Satan derives from the convergence
   of two other interpretive traditions: that the Antichrist is to be identified with the &#8216;sonne of
   perdition&#8217; of 2 Thess and that this sonship, an infernal mirror-image of Christ&#8217;s divine
   sonship, is disclosed at Gen 3:15, where God refers to the abiding hostility of the descendants

   is remembered in 1 Kings for his revival of idolatry (12:28). His successors, of whom Ahab (here
   &#8216;Achab&#8217;) is said to be the worst (1 Kings 16:30), are regularly condemned for committing the
   idolatry: &#8216;and it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of
   Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he [i.e., Ahab] took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king
   of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.&#8217; In their iconoclasm, then, the
   Reformers tax Catholics with committing the sins of Jeroboam; see Luther&#8217;s <span xmlns="" class="italics">Table-Talk</span>, CLXXV. The gloss to &#8216;Jezebel&#8217; at this juncture in the Geneva Bible &#8211; &#8216;By

The comparison of Frederick to Josiah may be especially pointed, since Josiah effected a major reformation not only in his own realm of Judah, but in the kingdom of Israel to the north as well. His fervent iconoclasm would have been an inspiration to the Antwerp reformers: at 2 Kings 23:4, Josiah burns the vessels used in the worship of Baal and carries the ashes to Bethel, the site where Jeroboam had erected his golden calves; at 23:5, he destroys the altar at Bethel.<lb/></mentioned></note>

   &#8216;Canzone of Visions&#8217;. The source canzone is constructed in twelve-line stanzas with a regular, if
   complex rhyme scheme, with a three-line <span xmlns="" class="italics">tornata</span> at the conclusion;
   Marot&#8217;s translation preserves the organization of the poem in twelve-line units, but changes the

   only traces &#8211; on my window and in the two objects (me) of hapned (indirect) and grieved (direct).
   Instead, Spenser gives us an absolute construction in the first line, the participle in which
   (being) can be attached only to an &#8216;I&#8217; that appears nowhere in the sentence, and is followed by
   two impersonal constructions, [it] hapned and it grieveth. Indeed, these opening lines are
   remarkable for a dreamlike ellipsis of specific subjects: if the visionary &#8216;I&#8217; does not securely
   manifest its presence, the things seen are not much more syntactically assertive, at least within
   this three-line introduction to the sequence. (Things appears at first to be the subject of

   an homage to Petrarch, widely felt to be the master of the form, for this particular poem takes
   up one of the central images of Petrarch&#8217;s <span xmlns="" class="italics">Rime sparse</span>, the laurel
   tree. In this poem and elsewhere in Petrarch&#8217;s collection, the image of the flourishing laurel
   effects a congruence between the apparently divergent objects of Petrarch&#8217;s longing, the beloved

The spirit&#8217;s admonition occupies the entire octave of Du Bellay&#8217;s poem, whereas, in Spenser&#8217;s rendering, the apparition speaks of the world&#8217;s inconstancy and, in the final three lines, the original speaker formulates the compensatory principle of confidence in God. The summary prologue and the demonstration of the speaker&#8217;s wisdom give the sequence a somewhat greater spiritual security than is offered in the preceding sequence. That said, this second sequence is also more sepulchral than the prior one: Spenser&#8217;s speaker is addressed by a ghost (<span xmlns="" class="italics">un Demon</span>, for Du Bellay) and the ensuing poems are haunted by the pathetic or monstrous vestiges of antiquity.</note>

    translation or the compositor who set it seems to have compressed his
    copy, reducing the first two of the three vices to a single one &#8211; &#8216;the
    luste of the eyes&#8217; &#8722; in a straightforward instance of eye-skip. The
    compositor may have fumbled the line further, since his copy may have
    read &#8216;as the lust, etc.&#8217; (which would translate &#8216;<hi rend="italics">ascavoir la
    concupiscence, etc.</hi>&#8217;), yet because &#8216;is the lust&#8217; corresponds to the
    syntax of the passage in the Vulgate, we have allowed the syntactically
    difficult &#8216;is&#8217; to stand. It may be worth remarking that, at this
    juncture, both the French and English texts expand on the Dutch original
    by quoting more extensively from 1 John.</note>

   Dutch: in the middle of the 16th-c the central region of the Netherlands, the region
   straddling the Rhine, was more influential politically than the Frisian region to the north, and
   the dialect spoken in Brabant seemed on the verge of becoming a more widely accepted
   trans-regional standard. As is observed in the introduction above, the commentary here misrepresents the
   genesis of the translations of the poems: the poems were translated from Marot&#8217;s French version

  <note type="commentary" target="#theatre_1587388913267548"><mentioned>vnderstode</mentioned>: The word is used similarly below at 394. The sense of
    the term as used here -- not an unfamiliar one in Spenser&#8217;s period --
    suggests a semantic peculiarity central to visionary poetry. If we think
    of Petrarch as a passive witness to these visions, this <hi rend="italics">understanding</hi>
    may be taken as his interpretation of that visionary experience (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi>
    &#8216;understand&#8217; 5a); if we think of Petrarch as the inventor of these
    visions, this <hi rend="italics">understanding</hi> may be taken as the meaning he intends for
    us to derive from his description of those visions (<hi rend="italics">OED</hi> &#8216;understand&#8217;
    The dual sense of &#8216;<hi rend="italics">understand</hi>&#8217; thus anticipates the very similar

    The ensuing account of the &#8216;traditions of men&#8217; is a condensed summary of
    those aspects of Catholic doctrine and worship to which the Reformers
    were most vehemently opposed, characterized as <hi rend="italics">traditions of men</hi> (with
    the same disapproving connotations of the word, &#8216;<hi rend="italics">traditions</hi>&#8217;, as are
    intended two sentences earlier) to distinguish them from those aspects
    of doctrine of workshop that, the Reformers contended, could be securely
    founded on Scripture. Van der Noot continues to follow de Coninck's
    translation of Bale&#8217;s <hi rend="italics">Image</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Bilde</hi>, K1r-K1v; <hi rend="italics">Image</hi>, 110), while

    the Reformers, but Calvinists like van der Noot were especially fervent
    in their sabbatarianism and in their strict abridgement in the number of
    holidays celebrated: many mid-century Calvinist churches celebrated only
    the Sabbath, Christmas, Easter, and Whitsunday, and there was a brief
    period in Geneva when even the celebration of Christmas was proscribed.</p>
    
    <p>The item marks a departure from Bale, who refers at this juncture to

    glosses in <hi rend="italics">Theatre</hi> generally match those in the French version,
    although in a few instances those in the English text to misrepresent
    their copy. At this juncture both the English and French versions
    correct a reference to <hi rend="italics">Esaias.1.</hi> in the Dutch text; van der Noot
    plainly means to allude to Isaiah 13:17-22. The English and French texts
    supply a reference to Nahum that is missing in the Dutch, although the
    gloss supplied, &#8216;<hi rend="italics">Nahum</hi>.23.&#8217; requires emendation, since Nahum has only
    three chapters. The French and English do not always improve on their
    Dutch source. The French mistransmits the Dutch gloss to the first
    chapter of 1 Maccabees as a reference to the second chapter of 1
    Maccabees -- although 1 Macc 2 is relevant to the discussion at hand,
    the oppressions of Antiochus are most vividly narrated in the first
    chapter of 1 Macc. The English makes matters worse, offering a reference
    to the second chapter of 2 Maccabees, repeating the reference on both
    the recto and verso of G5. (The reading in the English version seems to
    reflect the French text, which reads &#8216;I. Macha.2.&#8217;, but the first &#8216;I&#8217; is
    poorly inked in the copy we examined and might have been misread as a
    &#8216;2&#8217;, hence the English gloss &#8216;2. Macha. 2.&#8217; We emend, restoring what we
    take to be the reading of Roest&#8217;s copy.) In general, the English glosses
    reproduce the French ones somewhat carelessly: references to chapter
    spans -- two and three in Esther (&#8216;<hi rend="italics">Hester 2.3.</hi>) and 3 through 6 in 2
    Chronicles (&#8216;<hi rend="italics">2. Paral. 3.6.</hi>&#8217;) -- were misconstrued and set as
    references to Esther 23 and 2 Chron 36. However, the reference to the
    span in 2 Chron, which <hi rend="italics">Le Th&#233;atre</hi> carries over from <hi rend="italics">Het Theatre</hi>, is
    inaccurate: the English gloss, &#8216;2. Paralip. 36&#8217; is indeed correct, since
    the relevant passage is in chapter 36 (verses 17-23). It may be
    observed, finally, that some errors or unhelpfulnesses persist from the
    Dutch to the French to the English. Habak 1 marvels over the conquests
    of the Chaldeans, but the curse on them is withheld until 2:8 and
    the gloss, &#8216;<hi rend="italics">Esay. 22</hi>&#8217; may be a reference to the captivity of
    Shebna at Isa 22:17, but context strongly suggests that this, like the
    rest of Isa 22, concerns an Assyrian conquest, not one of Persians or
    Medes. (The Geneva glosses construe Isa 22 as a prophecy of Babylonian
    conquest &#8211; again, not Persian or Medean.)

    While <hi rend="italics">sodomy</hi> (or, here, &#8216;Sodometrie&#8217;, as in van der
    Noot&#8217;s original Dutch) is often used in early modern texts to comprise
    the full field of proscribed sexual practices (and thus substantially
    overlaps <hi rend="italics">uncleannesse</hi>), it sometimes seems especially to evoke sexual
    activities between men, hence the frequent use of the term in
    denunciations of monks.

    interest themselves especially in the dynamics of apocalyptic justice:
    to those who, refusing truth, secure authority by means of illusion, God
    responds by inflicting delusion, leaving the deceivers sunk in

    and practice that he judges to be without scriptural warrant. Here, as
    elsewhere, van der Noot mutes anti-semitic notes in Bale and &#8211; perhaps
    because the first version of this commentary was prepared for a

    glosses filling the margin from the bottom of H4v to the top of H5r
    collectively refer to a series of scriptural passages that address the
    difficult necessity of maintaining faith in spite of worldly trials: Col
    John 14:16-19, Matt 24:13, Luke 9:62, Eph 6:12, 1 Cor 6:6-8, Acts
    and 6:11-13, Ex 1:13-14, Esther 3:13, 1 Macc 1:11, Matt 20:12-16,

    disentangle once one accepts its parenthetical structure: As did the
    Pharisees in the time of Christ and his apostles, the worshippers of the

    would be relieved were we to emend three instances of the singular &#8216;him&#8217;
    (at 922, 927, and 928) and one of &#8216;he&#8217; (927), adjusting them in accord
    with the plural &#8216;them&#8217; of 918 and 925, so that these pronouns would
    refer securely to &#8216;the true witnesses, and godly preachers of Christ&#8217;
    (914-5). Arguing against emendation of the pronouns is the fact that
    <hi rend="italics">Het Theatre</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Le th&#233;atre</hi> exhibit a similarly confusing mix of
    pronouns.</note>

    Roest&#8217;s translation slightly elaborates the Dutch original &#8216;<hi rend="italics">voer

    noch en sijn sij hier mede niet te vreden, voer dat syse in de teghen

    with their edict [by which they confirm the laiety in its errors],
    they vanquish them; although they are not vanquished before God&#8217;; F4v).
    Roest departs from his source in two ways, both of which emphasize the
    corrupt judicial procedure loosely evoked by the Dutch original. First,
    he adapts the doubled description of imprisonment in <hi rend="italics">Het Theatre</hi>,
    combining them into the single &#8216;haue him fast in prison&#8217; and replacing
    the second member of the pair with a reference to a future trial, &#8216;and
    forthcomming&#8217; (that is, within easy reach of a court, in custody).
    Second, he inserts the phrase &#8216;(as they boast) to condemne&#8217;, which has
    no obvious source in the Dutch, in order to specify that the godly are
    &#8216;vanquished&#8217; as part of a corrupt process of conviction. We adjust the
    punctuation of the clause concerning the polemical use of the &#8216;placcate&#8217;
    to reflect that of the Dutch original and so to clarify the
    parenthetical syntax of the passage.</note>

    baptism by water (which itself follows a first anointing with

    at baptism and at the ordination of priests, but also at adult
    confirmation and at the ordination of bishops. Like bishops, adult
    confirmands were anointed on the forehead. Van der Noot&#8217;s device here is
    to mobilize what he seems to regard as settled anti-episcopal sentiment
    to undermine confirmation itself, the protestant opposition to which was

    adapts Bale&#8217;s (<hi rend="italics">Image</hi>, 299; <hi rend="italics">Bilde</hi>, Ss8v), adding Wycliff, Hus, Beza,
    Viret, Peter Martyr, Alasco, and Regius and dropping Reuchlin, Erasmus,
    Pomeran, Grineus, and a variety of English reformers. Besides such
    familiar figures as Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon, and Zwingli, the list
    reaches back to Wycliffe, the fourteenth-century founder of the English
    Lollard movement who completed a translation of the New Testament
    shortly before his death, and to the Czech reformer, Jan Hus, a follower
    of Wycliffe who shard the English reformer&#8217;s anti-papal ecclesiology and
    his hostility to indulgences. The rest of the figures are all
    contemporaries or followers of Luther: Johannes Oecolampadius, an early
    champion of Luther and, as an assistant to Zwingli, a major force in the
    Swiss Reformation; Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Capito, the Zwinglian
    theologians who collaborated on the so-called Strasbourg or Tetrapolitan
    Confession; Theodore Beza, most important, perhaps, as Calvin&#8217;s
    successor as leader of the Genevan church, but also interesting to van
    der Noot, presumably, as Marot&#8217;s collaborator in the production of a
    French verse translation of the psalter; Pierre Viret, Beza&#8217;s early
    patron and one of the most popular reformed preachers in southern France
    and French-speaking Switzerland; the Italian theologian, Pietro Martire
    Vermigli, who at one time, like Bucer, Regius Professor of Divinity at
    Oxford, and who ended his career in Zurich, having had a profound
    influence on Calvinist Eucharistic theology; Heinrich Bullinger, author
    of the Second Helvetic Confession, Zwingli&#8217;s successor in Z&#252;rich, and a
    figure of considerable influence in England; Johannes Alasco (Jan
    &#321;aski), sometime superintendent of the Strangers&#8217; Church in London, who
    ended a career of striving to reconcile the breach between Calvinist and
    Lutheran communities as superintendent all the Reformed Churches of
    Little Poland; the Swabian controversialist and author of the
    W&#252;rttemberg Confession, Johannes Brenz, whose contributions in matters
    of church polity and educational practice were as important to the
    development of Lutheranism as were his efforts in eucharistic theology;
    and Urban Rieger, a gifted Lutheran systematic theologian, whose career
    divides between positions in Augsburg and in Braunschweig.

    objects to which, the reformers claimed, Catholics wrongfully attribute
    an instrumental spiritual efficacy. For oil and cream, see 884n and
    The use of blessed salt as an adjunct to baptism, as a
    sacramental, that is, as an incitement to piety, and as an instrumental
    for sanctifying a room or threshold was notorious, since, even for
    Catholics, it seemed to occupy a grey area of the magical, the not-quite
    sacred. &#8216;Waxe&#8217; may refer to the large Paschal candle lit during the
    Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday or to another sacramental, like blessed
    salt or the blessed &#8216;palms&#8217; often distributed to the faithful on Palm
    Sunday: the waxen sacramental is the Agnus Dei, a wax disk (sometimes
    fabricated of wax mixed with chrism) on which is impressed the image of
    a lamb, the Lamb of God; the papal arms are often impressed on the
    reverse of these disks, which are blessed by the pope. Holy &#8216;Ashes&#8217; are
    another sacramental, strewn on the head or marked on the forehead of

    We emend here, replacing the irrelevant reference to Isaiah. It
    may be observed that, in <hi rend="italics">Het Theatre</hi>, the gloss equivalent to that at
    in <hi rend="italics">Theatre</hi> refers to two chapters in Ezechial &#8211;&#8216;<hi rend="italics">Eze.</hi> 43.37&#8217;
    (K7v)&#8211;while the gloss to the passage equivalent to that at 2418-9 in

Iohn. 15. [marginal glosses]</mentioned>: At this
    juncture, spanning Q3v-4r, the glossing is variously disturbed, and we
    have emended and relocated several glosses to remedy the disturbance.
    The disorder begins with the reference to John 14 which treats of
    keeping the commandments of Christ as love of Christ, and of the
    Father&#8217;s reciprocation of love offered to the Son; the gloss has no
    equivalent in <hi rend="italics">Het Theatre</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Le th&#233;atre</hi>,and is only loosely relevant
    to themes taken upon these pages. (More pertinent, would be a gloss
    indicating that 2864-7 simply quotes Matt 7:21.) Nor is it the only
    tenuously relevant gloss on these pages that is not witnessed in either
    the Dutch or French versions: a reference to John 17 following which
    follows those to John 12, Luke 6, and Matt 5, seems generally
    impertinent and we take it to be an error somehow related to the
    disappearance of a reference to John 13:16, quoted directly after a
    quotation of John 12:25-6 and glossed in <hi rend="italics">Het Theatre</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Le th&#233;atre</hi>.
    (Confident of the link between the anomalous reference to John 17 and
    the disappearance of the gloss to John 13, we restore the latter, and
    delete the former.) It may be observed that the English <hi rend="italics">Theatre</hi> is not
    alone in offering perplexing glosses at this juncture, since both <hi rend="italics">Het
    Theatre</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Le th&#233;atre</hi> offer references to Gen 16. The absence of
    this reference in <hi rend="italics">Theatre</hi> may evidence editorial shrewdness or
    carelessness; the missing gloss is replaced by a reference to John 15,
    the second of two in sequence &#8211; which latter detail would argue for
    carelessness were it not that the two references may be understood as
    referring distinctly to verses 10 and 12.</note>

    cohere closely with each other, while the text of the <hi rend="italics">Theatre</hi> differs

    restore the internal logic of the sentence and its fidelity to its chief

    spirit of Heb 10:31 (&#8216;It is a feareful thing to fall into the hands of
    the liuing God&#8217;), and with the Dutch and French versions of the passage,
    a preference for the hands of men over the hands of the Lord is
    inconsistent with the rest of the sentence, which emphasizes God&#8217;s
    mercy, and with the conclusion of Ecclesus 2, on which this portion of
    van der Noot&#8217;s commentary is based. In Luther&#8217;s version, the chapter
    concludes &#8216;<hi rend="italics">Wir wollen lieber in die Hende des HERRN fallen / weder in
    die Hende der Menschen / Denn seine Barmherzigkeit ist ja so gros / als
    Er selber ist</hi>&#8217; (&#8216;We would rather fall in the hands of the Lord than in
    the hands of men, for his mercy is as great as He himself is&#8217;) and
    Liesveldt&#8217;s Dutch version of 1535, a likely sourtce for van der Noot&#8217;
    hews close to it: &#8216;<hi rend="italics">Beter ist ons te vallen inden handen des HEREN / dan
    inden handen der menscen / want hoe wel hy hooch en groot is / nochtans

    Lord than in the hands of men, for although he is high and great, yet is
    he very merciful&#8217;). It may be observed, however, that the Geneva
    translation, like the Vulgate, is framed as a monitory condition &#8211; &#8216;[If
    we do not repent] we shal fall in to the hands of the Lord, and not
    into the hands of men&#8217; &#8211; which, since it frames the judgment of the Lord
    as a threat might argue for van der Noot&#8217;s text as printed, yet even in
    the Geneva version, the chapter ends with emphasis on divine clemency:
    &#8216;yet as his greatness is, so is his mercie&#8217;.</note>

    Dioclesian, and Maxentius (<hi rend="italics">Maxence</hi>) in his list of persecutors of the
    early Church at 466-7; Maximian Herculius would also have figured
    suitably in that list, since Augustine makes him responsible, along with
    his co-emperor Diocletian, for the last of the ten great pre-Apocalyptic
    persecutions of the Church (see 466-7n). The perplexing inclusion of the
    Christian emperor Jovian (ruled 363-4) in this list is somewhat
    clarified by the way he is invoked in <hi rend="italics">Het Theater</hi>: &#8216;<hi rend="italics">noch eenen
    anderen Maximius die Iouianus toeghenompt was</hi>&#8217; (&#8216;yet another Maximian,
    who was known as Jovian&#8217;; N3r). Galerius Maximianus, this &#8216;other
    Maximian&#8217; (rules 305-11) was another persecutor of the Christians.
    Constantius (353-61) is listed here for his support of Arianism and his
    opposition to Athanasius, while Phocas, ruler of the eastern Empire from
    was indeed notorious for his cruelty. But Licinius (308-24) does
    not quite belong on this list, for he urged the toleration of
    Christians; his reputation for opposition to Christianity is the result
    of a propaganda campaign mounted against him by his brother, Constantine
    I, who eventually secured his execution.</note>
